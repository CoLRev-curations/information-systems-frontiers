   abstract                      = {Abstract In crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to support users when dealing with social media content. Considering digital resilience, we propose a web app based on Social Network Analysis (SNA) to provide an overview of potentially misleading vs. non-misleading content on Twitter, which can be explored by users and enable foundational learning. The latter aims at systematically identifying thematic patterns which may be associated with misleading information. Additionally, it entails reflecting on indicators of misleading tweets which are proposed to approach classification of tweets. Paying special attention to non-expert users of social media, we conducted a two-step Think Aloud study for evaluation. While participants valued the opportunity to generate new knowledge and the diversity of the application, qualities such as equality and rapidity may be further improved. However, learning effects outweighed individual costs as all users were able to shift focus onto relevant features, such as hashtags, while readily pointing out content characteristics. Our design artifact connects to learning-oriented interventions regarding the spread of misleading information and tackles information overload by a SNA-based plug-in.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Semantic interoperability establishes intercommunications and enables data sharing across disparate systems. In this study, we propose an ostensive information architecture for healthcare information systems to decrease ambiguity caused by using signs in different contexts for different purposes. The ostensive information architecture adopts a consensus-based approach initiated from the perspective of information systems re-design and can be applied to other domains where information exchange is required between heterogeneous systems. Driven by the issues in FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) implementation, an ostensive approach that supplements the current lexical approach in semantic exchange is proposed. A Semantic Engine with an FHIR knowledge graph as the core is constructed using Neo4j to provide semantic interpretation and examples. The MIMIC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) datasets and diabetes datasets have been employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed information architecture. We further discuss the benefits of the separation of semantic interpretation and data storage from the perspective of information system design, and the semantic reasoning towards patient-centric care underpinned by the Semantic Engine.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Bearings are vital components in rotating machinery. Undetected bearing faults may result not only in financial loss, but also in the loss of lives. Hence, there exists an abundance of studies working on the early detection of bearing faults. The rising use of deep learning in recent years increased the number of imaging types/neural network architectures used for bearing fault classification, making it challenging to choose the most suitable 2-D imaging method and neural network. This study aims to address this challenge, by sharing the results of the training of eighteen imaging methods with four different networks using the same vibration data and training metrics. To further strengthen the results, the validation dataset size was taken as five times the training dataset size. The best results obtained is 99.89% accuracy by using Scattergram Filter Bank 1 as the image input, and ResNet-50 as the network for training. Prior to our work, Scattergram images have never been used for bearing fault classification. Ten out of 72 methods used in this work resulted in accuracies higher than 99.5%.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Organizations are integrating big data technologies with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems with an aim to enhance ERP responsiveness (i.e., the ability of the ERP systems to react towards the large volumes of data). Yet, organizations are struggling to manage the integration between the ERP systems and big data technologies, leading to lack of ERP responsiveness. For example, it is difficult to manage large volumes of data collected through big data technologies and to identify and transform the collected data by filtering, aggregating and inferencing through the ERP systems. Building on this motivation, this research examined the factors leading to ERP responsiveness with a focus on big data technologies. The conceptual model which was developed through a systematic literature review was tested using Structural equation modelling (SEM) performed on the survey data collected from 110 industry experts. Our results suggested 12 factors (e.g., big data management and data contextualization) and their relationships which impact on ERP responsiveness. An understanding of the factors which impact on ERP responsiveness contributes to the literature on ERP and big data management as well as offers significant practical implications for ERP and big data management practice.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Text-to-GraphQL (Text2GraphQL) is a task that converts the user's questions into Graph + QL (Query Language) when a graph database is given. That is a task of semantic parsing that transforms natural language problems into logical expressions, which will bring more efficient direct communication between humans and machines. The existing related work mainly focuses on Text-to-SQL tasks, and there is no available semantic parsing method and data set for the graph database. In order to fill the gaps in this field to serve the medical Human–Robot Interactions (HRI) better, we propose this task and a pipeline solution for the Text2GraphQL task. This solution uses the Adapter pre-trained by “the linking of GraphQL schemas and the corresponding utterances” as an external knowledge introduction plug-in. By inserting the Adapter into the language model, the mapping between logical language and natural language can be introduced faster and more directly to better realize the end-to-end human–machine language translation task. In the study, the proposed Text2GraphQL task model is mainly constructed based on an improved pipeline composed of a Language Model, Pre-trained Adapter plug-in, and Pointer Network. This enables the model to copy objects' tokens from utterances, generate corresponding GraphQL statements for graph database retrieval, and builds an adjustment mechanism to improve the final output. And the experiments have proved that our proposed method has certain competitiveness on the counterpart datasets (Spider, ATIS, GeoQuery, and 39.net) converted from the Text2SQL task, and the proposed method is also practical in medical scenarios.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This study investigates the factors that build resistance and attitude towards AI voice assistants (AIVA). A theoretical model is proposed using the dual-factor framework by integrating status quo bias factors (sunk cost, regret avoidance, inertia, perceived value, switching costs, and perceived threat) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) variables. The study model investigates the relationship between the status quo factors and resistance towards adoption of AIVA, and the relationship between TAM factors and attitudes towards AIVA. A sample of four hundred and twenty was analysed using structural equation modeling to investigate the proposed hypotheses. The results indicate an insignificant relationship between inertia and resistance to AIVA. Perceived value was found to have a negative but significant relationship with resistance to AIVA. Further, the study also found that inertia significantly differs across gender (male/female) and age groupings. The study's framework and results are posited as adding value to the extant literature and practice, directly related to status quo bias theory, dual-factor model and TAM.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This paper presents a novel author profiling method specially aimed at classifying social network users into the multidimensional perspectives for social business intelligence (SBI) applications. In this scenario, being the user profiles defined on demand for each particular SBI application, we cannot assume the existence of labelled datasets for training purposes. Thus, we propose an unsupervised method to obtain the required labelled datasets for training the profile classifiers. Contrary to other author profiling approaches in the literature, we only make use of the users’ descriptions, which are usually part of the metadata posts. We exhaustively evaluated the proposed method under four different tasks for multidimensional author profiling along with state-of-the-art text classifiers. We achieved performances around 88% and 98% of F1 score for a gold standard and a silver standard datasets respectively. Additionally, we compare our results to other supervised approaches previously proposed for two of our tasks, getting very close performances despite using an unsupervised method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method designed to label user profiles in an unsupervised way for training profile classifiers with a similar performance to fully supervised ones.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Understanding student sentiment plays a vital role in understanding the changes that could or should be made in curriculum design at university. Learning Analytics (LA) has shown potential for improving student learning experiences and supporting teacher inquiry. Yet, there is limited research that reports on the adoption and actual use of LA to support teacher inquiry. This four-year longitudinal study captures sentiment of postgraduate students at a university in Ireland, by integrating LA with the steps of teacher inquiry. This study makes three important contributions to teaching and learning literature. First, it reports on the use of LA to support teacher inquiry over four one-year cycles of a Master of Science in Business Analytics programme between 2016 and 2020. Second, it provides evidence-based recommendations on how to optimise LA to support teacher inquiry, with specific attention as to how these can improve the assimilation of LA into the curriculum design and delivery. Third, the paper concludes with a research agenda to help improve the adoption and integration of LA in the future.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Social commerce (s-commerce) has gained prominence with advances in social media and social networking technologies over the last decade. Prior research has employed diverse theoretical perspectives to understand and explain consumer behavior within s-commerce but has also produced inconsistent results. This study integrates different theoretical perspectives including trust, social support, and social presence. The research portrays an integrated research model involving factors that impact behavioral intention and use behavior of s-commerce consumers whilst synthesizing prior empirical findings. A meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) method was used to synthesize 189 findings reported in 68 s-commerce studies and to analyze the structural model. Our findings show that trust and informational support have positive effects on behavioral intention while trust and emotional support have positive effects on use behavior. Furthermore, our findings highlight that behavioral intention influences use behavior and mediates the effect of trust and informational support on use behavior. The implications for research and practice are discussed in detail.},

Whilst existing IS work has explored various factors influencing STS development, there is a lack of consideration of how value can be created for building a more sustainable STS. Drawing upon the value co-creation theory and stakeholder theory, we seek to understand the socio-technical shaping of the STS ecosystem and how government, firms and citizens collaboratively create sustainable value for designing and implementing STS initiatives. To reach this aim, we carry out a longitudinal case study over 2016–2018 in Shijiazhuang, China. We offer both theoretical and practical explanations on (i) key value facets with regard to sustainable STS design and implementation; and (ii) a holistic view of iterative value co-creation process pushed by key stakeholders. This study makes particular contributions to the IS, marketing and transportation literature by offering a critical understanding of the social dynamics for shaping a big data-driven STS ecosystem.},

This centralised model relies on using IoT data by highly qualified experts replacing previous smaller local structures. We draw on the notion of Situational Awareness to carry out the study. Results show that although the operators were not always familiar with the characteristics of locations, the use of IoT data heightened their situational awareness in the centralised control room by improving perception and comprehension. However, they still relied on local knowledge and learned experiences to support projection and anticipation of risks. The study highlights that although data analytics systems are capable of expanding operators’ perception of local elements, they must be complemented by local richer forms of information, needed to anticipate risks and make critical decisions with major impact on local population.},

Augmented reality could be used to visualize the wealth of user-generated content available on social media and enable context-adaptive functions for emergency operators. Although emergency operators agree that social media analytics will be important for their future work, it poses a challenge to filter and visualize large amounts of social media data. We conducted a goal-directed task analysis to identify the situation awareness requirements of emergency operators. By collecting tweets during two storms in Germany we evaluated the usefulness of Twitter data for achieving situation awareness and conducted interviews with emergency operators to derive filter strategies for social media data. We synthesized the results by discussing how the unique interface of augmented reality can be used to integrate social media data into emergency control rooms for situation awareness support.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is transforming the healthcare sector. However, despite this, the associated ethical implications remain open to debate. This research investigates how signals of AI responsibility impact healthcare practitioners’ attitudes toward AI, satisfaction with AI, AI usage intentions, including the underlying mechanisms. Our research outlines autonomy, beneficence, explainability, justice, and non-maleficence as the five key signals of AI responsibility for healthcare practitioners. The findings reveal that these five signals significantly increase healthcare practitioners’ engagement, which subsequently leads to more favourable attitudes, greater satisfaction, and higher usage intentions with AI technology. Moreover, ‘techno-overload’ as a primary ‘techno-stressor’ moderates the mediating effect of engagement on the relationship between AI justice and behavioural and attitudinal outcomes. When healthcare practitioners perceive AI technology as adding extra workload, such techno-overload will undermine the importance of the justice signal and subsequently affect their attitudes, satisfaction, and usage intentions with AI technology.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic illustrates that we are never far away from situations that have a scale and impact, which are difficult to predict. Positioned at the intersection of crisis management and resilience, this insider case-study provides the opportunity for a more complete understanding of the organisation-adversity relationship (Williams et al., 2017), by focusing on the third Covid19 wave in Ireland (Dec 2020) and resulting response by an Intensive Care Unit crisis team. The study examines the evolution of seven data supply chains that were developed to support the ICU crisis team through the surge of cases which put the highest level of strain on the Irish health system since the pandemic began. The study focuses on 289 data reviews, which triggered 63 changes each requiring a new iteration of a data supply chain. Incorporating Organisational Mindfulness as the theoretical framework, the study provides an insight into the realities of data management during a crisis but also provides a rich awareness of the complexities of data management that often go unrecognised. In doing so, the study contributes the concept of ‘mindful data’, which aids managers to understand the key characteristics of resilient data supply chains. The study also provides a rare first-hand insight into how mindful data was constructed, presented, and evolved into an essential element within the critical care environment.},

However, despite the use of AI, businesses continue to face challenges and are unable to immediately realize performance gains. Furthermore, firms need to introduce robust AI systems and mitigate AI risks, which emphasizes the importance of creating suitable AI governance practices. This study, explores how AI governance is applied to promote the development of robust AI applications that do not introduce negative effects, based on a comparative case analysis of three firms in the energy sector. The study illustrates which practices are placed to produce knowledge that assists with decision making while at the same time overcoming barriers with recommended actions leading to desired outcomes. The study contributes by exploring the main dimensions relevant to AI’s governance in organizations and by uncovering the practices that underpin them.},

Technological frames provide a theoretical perspective for understanding how actors interpret a technology and act upon its development, use, and governance. However, we know little about how actors shape technological frames. In this paper, we study the shaping of the technological frame of the European ecosystem for responsible AI (RAI). Through an analysis of EU documents, we identified four expectations that constitute the EU’s technological frame for the RAI ecosystem. Moreover, through interviews with RAI actors, we revealed five types of expectation work responding to this frame: reproducing, translating, and extending (congruent expectation work), and scrutinizing and rooting (incongruent expectation work). Furthermore, we conceptualize expectation work as actors’ purposive actions in creating and negotiating expectations. Our study contributes to the literature on technological frames, technology-centered ecosystems, and RAI while also elucidating the dimensions and co-shaping of technological frames.},

At the same time, scientific laboratories still rely upon digital files that are processed by experimenters to analyze and communicate laboratory results. In this study, we first apply a forensic process to investigate the information quality of digital evidence underlying published results. Furthermore, we use semiotics to describe the quality of information recovered from storage systems with laboratory forensics techniques. Next, we formulate laboratory analytics capabilities based on the results of the forensics analysis. Laboratory forensics and analytics form the basis of research data management. Finally, we propose a conceptual overview of open science readiness, which combines laboratory forensics techniques and laboratory analytics capabilities to help overcome research data management challenges in the near future.},

However, in Japan at large, issuing of damage certificates has taken a long time in past earthquake disasters. Hence, the government needs a more efficient mechanism for issuing damage certificates. This study developed an estimation system of roof-damaged buildings to obtain an overview of earthquake damage based on aero-photo images using deep learning. To provide speedy estimation, this system utilized the trimming algorithm, which automatically generates roof image data using the location information of building polygons on GIS (Geographic Information System). Consequently, the proposed system can estimate, if a house is covered with a blue sheet with 97.57 % accuracy and also detect whether a house is damaged, with 93.51 % accuracy. It would therefore be worth considering the development of an image recognition model and a method of collecting aero-photo data to operate this system during a real earthquake.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The emerging information revolution makes it necessary to manage vast amounts of unstructured data rapidly. As the world is increasingly populated by IoT devices and sensors that can sense their surroundings and communicate with each other, a digital environment has been created with vast volumes of volatile and diverse data. Traditional AI and machine learning techniques designed for deterministic situations are not suitable for such environments. With a large number of parameters required by each device in this digital environment, it is desirable that the AI is able to be adaptive and self-build (i.e. self-structure, self-configure, self-learn), rather than be structurally and parameter-wise pre-defined. This study explores the benefits of self-building AI and machine learning with unsupervised learning for empowering big data analytics for smart city environments. By using the growing self-organizing map, a new suite of self-building AI is proposed. The self-building AI overcomes the limitations of traditional AI and enables data processing in dynamic smart city environments. With cloud computing platforms, the self-building AI can integrate the data analytics applications that currently work in silos. The new paradigm of the self-building AI and its value are demonstrated using the IoT, video surveillance, and action recognition applications.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Customer relationship management (CRM) is a strategic approach to manage an organization’s interaction with current and potential customers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can analyze huge volume of data without human intervention. The integration of AI with existing legacy CRM system in the business to customer (B2C) relationship makes sense given the massive potential for growth of AI integrated CRM system. Failure to plan AI-CRM technology implementation in an organization could lead some to success and others to failure. The Contingency theory states that it is not possible for organizations to take decisions without a contingency plan and the optimal course of action depends on the internal and external circumstances. The Dynamic Capability View theory emphasizes the organizational ability to react adequately in a timely manner to any external changes and combines multiple capabilities of the organization, including organizational CRM and AI capabilities. Against this background, the purpose of this study is to examine the success and failure of implementation of AI integrated CRM system in an organization from B2C perspective using Contingency theory and Dynamic Capability View theory. The study finds that information quality, system fit, and organizational fit significantly and positively impact the implementation of AI-CRM for B2C relationship management. Also, there is a moderating impact of technology turbulence on both acceptance and failure of AI-CRM capability in the organization.},

In a design science research project, we develop a design for a conversational agent (CA) based on artificial intelligence to facilitate contributors in generating elaborate ideas on idea platforms where human facilitation is not scalable. We derive prescriptive design knowledge in the form of design principles, instantiate, and evaluate the CA in two successive evaluation episodes. The design principles contribute to the current research stream on automated facilitation and can guide providers of idea platforms to enhance idea generation and subsequent idea selection processes. Results indicate that CA-based facilitation is engaging for contributors and yields well-structured and elaborated ideas.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract To create competitive advantages, companies are leaning towards business analytics (BA) to make data-driven decisions. Nevertheless, users acceptance and effective usage of BA is a key element for its success. Around the globe, organizations are increasingly adopting BA, however, a paucity of research on examining the drivers of BA adoption and its continuance is noticeable in the literature. This is evident in developing countries where a higher number of systems and software development projects are outsourced. This is the first study to examine BA continuance in the context of software and systems development projects from the perspective of Pakistani software professionals. The data was collected from 186 Pakistani software professionals working in software and systems development projects. The data were analyzed using partial least squares - structural equation modelling techniques. Our structural model explains 45% variance on BA continuance intention, 69% variance on technological compatibility, and 59% variance on perceived usefulness. Our results show that confirmation has a direct impact on BA continuance intention in software and systems projects. The study has both theoretical and practical implications for professionals in the field of business analytics.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Millions of people experience mental health issues each year, increasing the necessity for health-related services. One emerging technology with the potential to help address the resulting shortage in health care providers and other barriers to treatment access are conversational agents (CAs). CAs are software-based systems designed to interact with humans through natural language. However, CAs do not live up to their full potential yet because they are unable to capture dynamic human behavior to an adequate extent to provide responses tailored to users’ personalities. To address this problem, we conducted a design science research (DSR) project to design personality-adaptive conversational agents (PACAs). Following an iterative and multi-step approach, we derive and formulate six design principles for PACAs for the domain of mental health care. The results of our evaluation with psychologists and psychiatrists suggest that PACAs can be a promising source of mental health support. With our design principles, we contribute to the body of design knowledge for CAs and provide guidance for practitioners who intend to design PACAs. Instantiating the principles may improve interaction with users who seek support for mental health issues.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract There have been multiple research studies in recent days that have analyzed the growing role of social media in firms’ communication strategy as well as the role of social media in shaping a firm’s reputation. However, most of these studies focus on one of the multiple social media platforms that firms use. In this study, we argue that there are nuances in firms’ social media communication strategies depending on the platforms. Given the rising importance of sustainability, we focus on firms’ sustainability-related communication. We analyze the impact of firms’ one-way sustainability communication over Twitter and Facebook on the respective platforms’ user engagement. The engagement has been computed as likes and shares (likes and retweets) over the firm generated one-way sustainability communication-related posts. Using a panel dataset of a 3-year period for S&P 500 firms having active social media profiles on both platforms, we demonstrate the difference in the firms’ sustainability communication on the two platforms. We also find evidence that users on both platforms have different preferences, such as messaging from firms. Using a differential metric in our analysis helps us counter the firm-level fixed effects. We find evidence suggesting that firms would do well by having different strategies for different platforms. Firms would benefit by focusing on sustainability relevant and bite-sized content on Twitter, but more positive and engaging content on Facebook.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Groups and communities have been key topics in the information systems (IS) research agenda. While communities are assumed to emerge at the intersection of overlapping groups and their practices, prior research has mainly focused on their dynamics and evolution. This has resulted to limited empirical support regarding the emergence of communities. We address that lacuna by tracing the emergence of communities through the prism of resource mobilization theory. In doing so, we make use of a unique longitudinal dataset and incorporate Topic Modelling, Bipartite Network Analysis, and Community Detection. We show that new communities are formed at the intersection of overlapping groups and practices. In addition, we contribute to the IS literature by demonstrating that their emergence occurs due to resource mobilization that gives rise to a shared mindset. We also reveal that multiple resources are incorporated into the practices of an emerging community. By combining large datasets and innovative computational approaches, we help IS theory and practice to move away from traditional "what" questions towards the more insightful "how" ones. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our work and delineate an agenda for future research on the topic.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract In the management of national electronic identity (eID) infrastructure, cooperation between public and private parties becomes more and more important, as the mutual dependencies between the provision of e-services and the provision of the national public key infrastructure (PKI) continuously increases. Yet, it is not clear which key factors affect the public-private collaboration in the eID field, as existing studies do not provide insight into this particular matter. Therefore, we aim to identify the factors that affect public-private partnership (PPP) in the field of eID. We also describe feasible formats that help to improve the cooperation between the two sectors, based on insights from the case of Estonia. In service of that study, we conducted twelve qualitative interviews with high-level experts representing several parties from the public and the private sector. By conducting a thematic analysis of the interviews, we identified five key factors for successful PPP in the eID field, i.e., engagement, joint understanding, two-way communication, clear role division, and process orientation. Furthermore, we generalize our results by discussing, in how far the found cooperation formats can be used by stakeholders to manage state-critical information technology (IT) infrastructure components similar to eID such as mobile phone services, data transmission services and digital signature services.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to bring to the physical retail environment the kind of mass personalisation that is already common in online commerce, delivering offers that are targeted to each customer, and that adapt to changes in the customer’s context. However, factors related to the in-store environment, the small screen where the offer is delivered, and privacy concerns, create uncertainty regarding how customers might react to highly personalised offers that are delivered to their smartphones while they are in a store. To investigate how customers exposed to this type of AI-enabled, personalised offer, perceive it and respond to it, we use the personalisation-privacy paradox lens. Case study data focused on UK based, female, fashion retail shoppers exposed to such offers reveal that they seek discounts on desired items and improvement of the in-store experience; they resent interruptions and generic offers; express a strong desire for autonomy; and attempt to control access to private information and to improve the recommendations that they receive. Our analysis also exposes contradictions in customers’ expectations of personalisation that requires location tracking. We conclude by drawing an analogy to the popular Snakes and Ladders game, to illustrate the delicate balance between drivers and barriers to acceptance of AI-enabled, highly personalised offers delivered to customers’ smartphones while they are in-store.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Organizations increasingly introduce collaborative technologies in form of virtual assistants (VAs) to save valuable resources, especially when employees are assisted with work-related tasks. However, the effect of VAs on virtual teams and collaboration remains uncertain, particularly whether employees show social loafing (SL) tendencies, i.e., applying less effort for collective tasks compared to working alone. While extant research indicates that VAs collaboratively working in teams exert greater results, less is known about SL in virtual collaboration and how responsibility attribution alters. An online experiment with N = 102 was conducted in which participants were assisted by a VA in solving a task. The results indicate SL tendencies in virtual collaboration with VAs and that participants tend to cede responsibility to the VA. This study makes a first foray and extends the information systems (IS) literature by analyzing SL and responsibility attribution thus updates our knowledge on virtual collaboration with VAs.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract COVID-19 caused significant challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the event industry. To address these challenges, many SMEs leveraged information and communication technologies (ICTs), with some even emerging strengthened from the crisis. Drawing on the technology-organization-environment framework and technology-affordances-and-constraints theory, we investigate the adoption of ICTs as a crisis response strategy in 10 SMEs in the German business event (e.g., corporate events, conferences) industry. Our findings reveal that ICT adoption not only depends on rational decisions based on organizational, environmental, and technological characteristics, but also on these dimensions’ interrelationship and the specific ICTs’ affordances and constraints. Introducing readily available ICTs (e.g., video-conferencing) has significant potential in addressing physical distancing in the short and medium term, while more sophisticated ICTs (e.g., virtual reality) are more likely to gain importance in the long term. Thus, we expand our understanding of organizational technology adoption and ICT-enabled crisis response strategies in SMEs.},

Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI) powered social media offers digital capabilities for organizations to select, screen, detect and predict problems with possible solutions through digital health data. Both the patients and healthcare professionals have benefited from such improvements. However, arising ethical concerns related to the use of AI raised by stakeholders need scrutiny which could help organizations obtain trust, minimize privacy invasion, and eventually facilitate the responsible success of AI-enabled social media operations. This paper examines the impact of responsible AI on businesses using insights from analysis of 25 in-depth interviews of health care professionals. The exploratory analysis conducted revealed that abiding by the responsible AI principles can allow healthcare businesses to better take advantage of the improved effectiveness of their social media marketing initiatives with their users. The analysis is further used to offer research propositions and conclusions, and the contributions and limitations of the study have been discussed.},

This is particularly concerning in a health context where lives are at stake and where there are significant sensitivities that are not as pertinent in other domains outside of health. This calls for a comprehensive analysis of health AI using responsible AI concepts as a structural lens.

   abstract                      = {Abstract Digital technologies are radically changing how established organizations design novel services. Digital transformation (DT) strategies are executed to manage the transition from product-centric to service-centric business models based on digital technologies. However, little is known about what configurations of DT strategies lead to successful digital service innovation (DSI) in established organizations. We employ fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis on a set of 17 case studies of DT strategies from established organizations with different industry backgrounds. We identify several distinct configurations of DT strategies that lead to successful and unsuccessful DSI. Based on these configurations, we deduce that the threat of digital disruption negatively impacts an organization’s innovation activities. Furthermore, we find that strategic partnerships can be leveraged by organizations that face an imminent threat of digital disruption while organizations with competitive advantages may rely on “do-it-yourself” approaches. Lastly, we find that the involvement of a C-level executive is a necessary requirement for successful DSI. Our results contribute to theory by integrating research on DSI and DT, providing a perspective on DSI failure, and employing a configurational research approach that allows us to highlight interdependencies between factors as well as insights into the individual factors. Furthermore, we provide actionable recommendations for executives.},

This high-level analysis coupled with a longitudinal view resolves inconsistent results between current AC studies and suggest further directions for organisational AC research.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Why do some firms organize their IT departments as profit centers whereas other firms organize IT as a cost center? These commonly employed organizational structures are characterized by information asymmetry and decision rights afforded to the IT department. The complexity of IT and its ongoing rapid evolution lead to information asymmetry where the IT department has private information about technology and cost, and the consuming departments have private information about demand. Under the cost center organizational structure, the firm sets the quality and number of IT services offered by the IT department. Whereas under a profit center structure, the IT department makes decisions on quality, price and variety of IT services. We find that the quality of IT services under the cost center decreases with greater uncertainty in demand for IT services. We also find that the cost center structure can offer higher quality IT services than the profit center structure, and consumption of IT services can be higher under the profit center structure. The preferred organizational structure does not always provide greater variety of IT services than the alternate structure. The cost center is preferred when the marginal cost of IT services is sufficiently low, or the fixed cost of quality is sufficiently high.},

The theoretical framing considers both drivers and barriers when combines the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) with innovation resistance theory (IRT). To empirically verify the proposed model, this study gathers primary data through a web-based, self-administered survey. To analyze the data, we use structural equation modeling, and to test for significant differences between the two groups we run multi-group analysis. The respondents in Italy and China present different behaviors. Social influence plays a significant role in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, such as Italy. The tradition barrier is the only significant barrier to the adoption of mobile payment.},

Platform owners provide Platform Boundary Resources (PBRs) to stimulate and control complementor engagement. Despite the increasing scholarly interest in digital platform ecosystems, their exact role in facilitating and channeling complementor engagement remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted an embedded case study on CMS platform ecosystems, comprising a total of 24 interviews with platform owners and complementors. We inductively derive five types of complementor engagement and their respective manifestations and two overarching engagement goals of complementors. Moreover, we determine the different types of PBRs utilized, including their critical effects, and distinguish between uniform and individual PBRs reflecting their respective generalizability and scalability. We discuss the findings by introducing the concepts of complementor resourcing and complementor securing and shed light on the standardization-individualization tension of PBRs faced by platform owners.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread at an unprecedented rate, many universities around the world halted physical forms of teaching and learning to stop the spread of the virus. As a result, many university students were forced to utilize online learning through channels such as mobile social media. Due to the novelty of this situation, there are many unknowns particularly with the negative influences of mobile learning via social media on university students. Thus, this study looks to examine this subject matter from the perspective of the stimulus–organism–response theory. The uniquely developed research model included four stimuli (i.e., social overload, information overload, life invasion, and privacy invasion), two organisms (i.e., technostress and exhaustion) as well as a response in terms of reduced intention to use mobile learning via social media. The responses were collected from 384 university students via an online survey and analyzed with the Partial-Least-Square-Structural-Equation-Modelling. It was found that the antecedents for both technostress and exhaustion were able to account for more than half of their respective variances. Furthermore, technostress and exhaustion were significant facilitators of the students’ reduced intention to use mobile learning via social media. In addition to the practical insights for stakeholders in the education industry, this study also posited several theoretical implications for researchers.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This paper investigates the functioning of Online Black-Markets (OBMs), i.e. a digital infrastructure operating in the Dark Net that enables the exchange of illegal goods such as drugs, weapons and fake digital identities. OBMs exist notwithstanding adverse conditions such as police interventions, scams and market breakdowns. Relying on a longitudinal case study, we focus on the dynamics of interactions among actors and marketplace technologies and we identify three mechanisms explaining OBMs operations. In particular, we show that OBMs infrastructure is the result of commoditization, platformization and resilience processes. Our contribution relies on the identification of community-based mechanisms that generate the OBMs infrastructure, extending the current understanding of e-commerce and social commerce.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) are a wide-ranging set of technologies that promise several advantages for organizations in terms off added business value. Over the past few years, organizations are increasingly turning to AI in order to gain business value following a deluge of data and a strong increase in computational capacity. Nevertheless, organizations are still struggling to adopt and leverage AI in their operations. The lack of a coherent understanding of how AI technologies create business value, and what type of business value is expected, therefore necessitates a holistic understanding. This study provides a systematic literature review that attempts to explain how organizations can leverage AI technologies in their operations and elucidate the value-generating mechanisms. Our analysis synthesizes the current literature and highlights: (1) the key enablers and inhibitors of AI adoption and use; (2) the typologies of AI use in the organizational setting; and (3) the first- and second-order effects of AI. The paper concludes with an identification of the gaps in the literature and develops a research agenda that identifies areas that need to be addressed by future studies.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Propelled by digitalisation, crowd knowledge (CK) has gained popularity alongside a plurality of related crowd-based concepts (crowdsourcing, wisdom of crowds and collective intelligence), resulting in an inconsistent understanding of the terms and their application. Based on a structured literature review, we conceptualise CK and develop a formal definition, which is then evaluated using knowledge artefacts on different crowd-related platforms and differentiation criteria in relation to participants, context, purpose and process. The paper posits that CK is conceptually different from related concepts, due to its dynamic nature and its instantiation in the form of a CK knowledge artefact which requires a specific context and a unique knowledge-creation process. Furthermore, we discuss how the concept of CK and its associated artefact relates to established knowledge management concepts such as knowledge assets and the flow of CK in the epistemological differentiation of knowledge into tacit and explicit elements. The article contributes to the formal conceptualisation of crowd-based concepts and therefore improves understanding of existing implementations and supports the prudent design of future systems.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract One realm of AI, recommender systems have attracted significant research attention due to concerns about its devastating effects to society’s most vulnerable and marginalised communities. Both media press and academic literature provide compelling evidence that AI-based recommendations help to perpetuate and exacerbate racial and gender biases. Yet, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which individuals might question AI-based recommendations when perceived as biased. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigate the effects of espoused national cultural values on AI questionability, by examining how individuals might question AI-based recommendations due to perceived racial or gender bias. Data collected from 387 survey respondents in the United States indicate that individuals with espoused national cultural values associated to collectivism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance are more likely to question biased AI-based recommendations. This study advances understanding of how cultural values affect AI questionability due to perceived bias and it contributes to current academic discourse about the need to hold AI accountable.},

The systematic and data-driven analysis of social media to generate business value is summarized under the term Social Media Analytics which includes statistical, network-based and language-based approaches. We focus on textual data and investigate which conversation topics arise during the time of a new product introduction on Twitter and how the overall sentiment is during and after the event. The analysis via Natural Language Processing tools is conducted in two languages and four different countries, such that cultural differences in the tonality and customer needs can be identified for the product. Different methods of sentiment analysis and topic modeling are compared to identify the usability in social media and in the respective languages English and German. Furthermore, we illustrate the importance of preprocessing steps when applying these methods and identify relevant product insights.},

In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based scheme that allows users to have control over the personal data revealed when accessing a service. The proposed solution does not rely on sophisticated cryptographic primitives, provides mechanisms for revoking the authorization to access a service and for guessing the identity of a user only in cases of need, and is compliant with the recent eIDAS Regulation. We prove that the proposed scheme is secure and reaches the expected goal, and we present an Ethereum-based implementation to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Scholars have extolled e-commerce as a pathway for sustaining firm operations in the unique circumstances of COVID-19. To add crisis time evidence to the body of work, and based on World Bank Enterprise Survey data, this inquiry interrogates 249 small manufacturing firms in Italy by examining the effect of e-commerce on (1) resilience, (2) direct exports and (3) indirect exports. The results show that while e-commerce has a positive impact on direct exports, a negative influence is recorded on indirect exports. Besides, e-commerce significantly increases resilience which, in turn, accelerates direct exports. However, resilience is found to have a trivial influence on indirect exporting. Furthermore, held as a constant, firm size demonstrates a significant and positive effect on direct and indirect exports. These fresh findings prompt implications for understanding the correlates of e-commerce, resilience and export behaviour. Practically, there are salient insights for stakeholders engaged in reviving small manufacturers’ exports for a speedy post COVID-19 recovery in Italy.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) organize themselves into clusters by sharing a set of limited resources to achieve the holistic success of the cluster. However, these SMEs often face conflicts and deadlock situations that hinder the fundamental operational dynamics of the cluster due to varied reasons, including lack of trust and transparency in interactions, lack of common consensus, and lack of accountability and non-repudiation. Blockchain technology brings trust, transparency, and traceability to systems, as demonstrated by previous research and practice. In this paper, we explore the role of blockchain technology in building a trustworthy yet collaborative environment in SME clusters through the principles of community self-governance based on the work of Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom. We develop and present a blockchain commons governance framework for the three main dimensions i.e., interaction, autonomy, and control, based on the theoretical premise of equivalence mapping and qualitative analysis. This paper examines the role of blockchain technology to act as a guiding mechanism and support the smooth functioning of SMEs for their holistic good. The study focuses on sustainability and improving productivity of SMEs operating in clusters under public and private partnership. This is the first study to address the operational challenges faced by SEMs in clusters by highlighting the dimensions of blockchain commons governance dimensions.},

Using an in-depth single case study, the digital divide is explored and understood using technology-mediated learning for older adults when using smart devices; ie. tablet devices. The case study is based on a group of educated, older Indian adult volunteers at a local Punjabi radio station. A qualitative approach used the data collection techniques of interviews, observations, informal conversations and reference to archival documents and interpretivism for analysis. Our findings revealed that older adults with ailments have shorter lives, contrary to popular perception, can be very active in their communities, are able to use basic IT and are willing to use technology when it leads to significant tangible or intangible benefits without considering the remaining time of their lives. Contributions for policymakers and industry are also offered in this paper.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract In supply chains where stakeholders belong to the economically disadvantaged segment and form an important part of the supply chain distribution, the complexities grow manifold. Fisheries in developing nations are one such sector where the complexity is not only due to the produce being perishable but also due to the livelihood dependence of others in the coastal regions that belong to the section of economically disadvantaged. This paper explains the contextual challenges of fish supply chain in a developing country and describes how integrating disruptive technologies can address those challenges. Through a positive deviance approach, we show how firms can help unorganized supply chains with economically disadvantaged suppliers by carefully redesigning the supply chain through the integration of satellite imagery and blockchain technology. With COVID-19 in the backdrop, we highlight how such technologies significantly improves the supply chain resilience and at the same time contributes to the income generating opportunities of poor fisherfolks in developing nations. Our study has important implications to both developing markets and food supply chain practitioners as this paper tackles issues such as perishability, demand-supply mismatch, unfair prices, and quality related data transparency in the entire value chain.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract COVID-19 has caused disruptions in the sharing economy for both platforms and owners, who are typically micro-businesses. Lower demand and ample supply means that users have a great deal of choice. Finding ways for properties to differentiate themselves has been a pressing need. Against this background, this paper pursued two objectives: firstly to explore the perceived functional and emotional value of smart accommodation and the factors contributing to this by adopting the Theory of Consumption Values, and secondly to examine the role of perceived value in driving intention to stay in smart accommodation in the future. 430 responses were collected to analyse the relationships among antecedents, value and intention. The results showed that the functional value of smart accommodation is associated with the perception that such accommodation represents good value for the price, smart devices are useful, they can enhance control of stay experiences, and there are resources and opportunities facilitating the use of technology. Emotional value is determined by the perception that staying in smart accommodation represents sustainable behaviour, the integration of smart home technologies offers control over the stay experience, improves the entertainment experience, aesthetics and playfulness of using technology. Emotional values are inhibited by the perception of surveillance in smart accommodation. Also, the study offers evidence of the correlation of intention with functional and emotional value. The evidence contributes to the literature by explaining the potential implications of innovative technologies for business recovery in the post-pandemic reality, exploring the applications of smart technologies in delivering tourism services, and identifying the factors in the adoption of smart homes in the hospitality sector. The findings provide practical implications for facilitating the applications of innovative technology and its adoption in home and non-home environments.},

This study proposes a holistic framework of sustainable performance by interrelating factors showing robust associations to produce this effect' for achieving sustainable performance in SMEs, through integrating the Technology Organisation Environment (TOE) and Resource Based View (RBV) models, to test how sustainable green practices can process the TOE factors when affecting sustainable performance. The research focuses on SMEs with worldwide employees and involves data collected from a range of different employees belonging to four different managerial levels. The process incorporated the analysis of 669 questionnaires to test the proposed hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings suggest that, together, TOE factors represent crucial inputs for green practices such as green training, green performance appraisal, that, in turn, mean critical processes lead to sustainable performance (output). Additionally, the findings should also inspire SMEs to focus even more effort on internal technological and organisational factors and to encourage an eco-friendly culture that would demand stakeholders adopt a more positive environmental stance.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on many industry sectors, forcing many companies and particularly Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to fundamentally change their business models under extreme time pressure. While there are claims that technologies such as analytics can help such rapid transitions, little empirical research exists that shows if or how Business Analytics (BA) supports the adaptation or innovation of SMEs’ business models, let alone within the context of extreme time pressure and turbulence. This study addresses this gap through an exemplar case, where the SME actively used location-based business analytics for rapid business model adaptation and innovation during the Covid-19 crisis. The paper contributes to existing theory by providing a set of propositions, an agenda for future research and a guide for SMEs to assess and implement their own use of analytics for business model transformation.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Rapid technological advancement can substantially impact the processes of digital forensic investigation and present a myriad of challenges to the investigator. With these challenges, it is necessary to have a standard digital forensic framework as the foundation of any digital investigation. State-of-the-art digital forensic models assume that it is safe to move from one investigation stage to the next. It guides the investigators with the required steps and procedures. This brings a great stride to validate a non-specific framework to be used in most digital investigation procedures. This paper considers a new technique for detecting active peers that participate in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. As part of our study, we crawled the µTorrent P2P client over ten days in different instances while logging all participating peers. We then employed digital forensic techniques to analyse the popular users and generate evidence within them with high accuracy. We evaluated our approach against the standard Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model for the digital investigation to achieve the credible digital evidence presented in this paper. Finally, we presented a validation case for the ADDIE model using the United States Daubert Test and the United Kingdom’s Forensic Science Regulator Guidance – 218 (FSR-G-218) and Forensic Science Regulator Guidance – 201 (FSR-G-201) to formulate it as a standard digital forensic model.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Today’s complex problems call for multidisciplinary analytics teams comprising of both analytics and non-technical domain (i.e. subject matter) experts. Recognizing the difference between data visualisaion (DV) (i.e. static visual outputs) and visual analytics (VA) (i.e. a process of interactive visual data exploration, guided by user’s domain and contextual knowledge), this paper focuses on VA for non-technical domain experts. By seeking to understand knowledge sharing from VA experts to non-technical users of VA in a multidisciplinary team, we aim to explore how these domain experts learn to use VA as a thinking tool, guided by their knowing-in-practice. The research described in this paper was conducted in the context of a long-term industry-wide research project called the ‘Visual Historical Atlas of the Australian Co-operatives’, led by a multidisciplinary VA team who faced the challenge tackled by this research. Using Action Design Research (ADR) and the combined theoretical lens of boundary objects and secondary design, the paper theorises a three-phase method for knowledge transfer, translation and transformation from VA experts to domain experts using different types of VA-related boundary objects. Together with the proposed set of design principles, the three-phase model advances the well-established stream of research on organizational use of analytics, extending it to the emerging area of visual analytics for non-technical decision makers.},

We can use semantic similarity models to help organize and optimize these devices. Even so, many of the proposed semantic similarity models do not consider the constrained and dynamic environments where these devices are present (IoT, edge computing, 5g, and next-generation networks). In this paper, we review the commonly used models, discuss the limitations of our previous model, and explore latent space methods (through matrix factorization) to reduce noise and correct the model profiles with no additional data. The new proposal is evaluated with corpus-based state-of-the-art approaches achieving competitive results while having four times faster training time than the next fastest model and occupying 36 times less disk space than the next smallest model.},

Despite this technology providing a paradigm shift in information technology (IT) services, the process through which the adoption of cloud computing effects organizational performance in the context of developing countries is still unclear. The aim of this study is to provide a theoretical discussion that advances our understanding about the mediating and moderating roles of organizational mindfulness in the context of cloud computing adoption and organizational performance. A research model is developed and tested using structural equation modelling. A firm level cross sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 180 organizations in the financial, manufacturing and IT sectors in Kenya. The findings reveal that organizations need to systematically develop mindfulness capabilities to benefit from the adoption of cloud, and IT innovations in general. The study has implications for research and practice.},

Drawing on complexity theory, we used a configurational approach to identify under what necessary and sufficient conditions, digitalisation contributes to achieve higher SC. Shifting attention from net effects to configuration analysis improves our understanding of cross-national differences in sustainability by exploring how the digitalisation factors combine to strengthen SC power across countries. To address the complexity of this configuration, we have incorporated fsQCA and NCA techniques in the modelling of high and low levels of sustainable competitiveness recipes. Analysis of data from 127 countries advanced our perception of how access to ICT infrastructures and capabilities, combined with the adoption and usage of ICT could result in different degrees of sustainable competitiveness. Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature on digitalisation and national sustainability; and it can practically act as a guideline for policymakers to understand the complex interactions and causal configurations of digitalisation factors on sustainability.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Humanitarian crises, such as the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, challenge information management and thereby threaten the digital resilience of the responding organizations. Crisis information management (CIM) is characterised by the urgency to respond despite the uncertainty of the situation. Coupled with high stakes, limited resources and a high cognitive load, crises are prone to induce biases in the data and the cognitive processes of analysts and decision-makers. When biases remain undetected and untreated in CIM, they may lead to decisions based on biased information, increasing the risk of an inefficient response. Literature suggests that crisis response needs to address the initial uncertainty and possible biases by adapting to new and better information as it becomes available. However, we know little about whether adaptive approaches mitigate the interplay of data and cognitive biases. We investigated this question in an exploratory, three-stage experiment on epidemic response. Our participants were experienced practitioners in the fields of crisis decision-making and information analysis. We found that analysts fail to successfully debias data, even when biases are detected, and that this failure can be attributed to undervaluing debiasing efforts in favor of rapid results. This failure leads to the development of biased information products that are conveyed to decision-makers, who consequently make decisions based on biased information. Confirmation bias reinforces the reliance on conclusions reached with biased data, leading to a vicious cycle, in which biased assumptions remain uncorrected. We suggest mindful debiasing as a possible counter-strategy against these bias effects in CIM.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Social media communication, and its impact on individuals and firms, is becoming increasingly important in today’s age. Firms are utilizing social media channels for communicating their sustainability-related initiatives. The role of social media as a mode for sustainability-related communication by firms has not been widely analyzed in the extant information systems literature. Given the increasingly important role of social media for information diffusion as well as increasing awareness for sustainability practices, this is a critical area of research. In this paper, we use an analytic model to theorize, coupled with empirical analysis to test the impact of firms’ sustainability practices. We have validated our proposed hypotheses using an empirical model based on panel data of firms’ sustainability performance and their Twitter communication over a 3-year period. Through our unique mixed-method study, we add additional methodological rigour to extant social media-based research in the information systems domain. Our research has significant theoretical and managerial significance as we identify how firms utilize social media for sustainability-related communication and its corresponding impact on customer response. Our research provides actionable insights for policymakers, firms as well as investors and consumers on understanding and managing sustainability-related communications on social media.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract One of the interesting types of spatio-temporal patterns is the Mixed-Drove Co-occurrence Pattern (MDCOP), which represents types of objects frequently located together in both space and time. To discover such patterns, methods based on the well-known Apriori strategy are widely used. They involve determining multi-element MDCOPs by building them up iteratively starting with the two-element patterns and then successively adding another element in each iteration. This approach can be very costly, particularly when the data is dense enough to form patterns of significant size. In this paper, we introduce a definition of a new pattern type called a Maximal Mixed-Drove Co-occurrence Pattern. We also propose a new algorithm MAXMDCOP-Miner, which resigns from popular Apriori strategy of generating candidates and, therefore, can discover long pattern without processing all their subsets. Experiments performed on synthetic and real datasets show that MAXMDCOP-Miner has high performance, in particular for dense datasets or tasks with low user-defined thresholds of spatial or time prevalence.},

The paper adopts a quasi-experimental design based on the analysis of multiple cases with each case replicating prior findings either literally or theoretically. The study uses a mix of survey, interview, and electronic data informed by an innovative, set-theoretic approach to distill commonalities within positive cases and differences between positive and negative cases. It shows that attracting new customers and raising the company’s profile are necessary pre-requisites for adaptive acceptance of social media policy changes. In addition, these two conditions combined with learning to use social media effortlessly are jointly sufficient for adaptive acceptance. Theoretical, practical, and methodological implications are discussed.},

Given the BC-Model’s potentially significant role in economic sustainability, it is important to evaluate its success. Efforts to measure the success of the BC-Model have been limited to date; this paper therefore presents a conceptual framework of BC-Model-Success consisting of six dimensions- economic, strategic, technological, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and social, resulting from a three-phase study design. The relevance of the framework was empirically validated across four implementations of the BC-Model. The resulting framework provides strong theoretical foundations for understanding what BC model success is, for assisting practitioners with evaluating the success of the BC-Model and with identifying possible improvements, and for facilitating future research on the BC-Model.},

VR can provide virtual experiences before, during, or in lieu of real-world visits to tourism sites. Hence, providing authentic experiences is essential to satisfy guests with the site and technology. This study analyzes survey data using PLS to identify the determinants of satisfaction with non-immersive VR experiences of heritage and non-heritage tourism sites. Results from 193 subjects reveal the linkages between system quality, object-related authenticity, activity-related authenticity, and presence, as well their relationship with satisfaction.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Multistores are data management systems that enable query processing across different and heterogeneous databases; besides the distribution of data, complexity factors like schema heterogeneity and data replication must be resolved through integration and data fusion activities. Our multistore solution relies on a dataspace to provide the user with an integrated view of the available data and enables the formulation and execution of GPSJ queries. In this paper, we propose a technique to optimize the execution of GPSJ queries by formulating and evaluating different execution plans on the multistore. In particular, we outline different strategies to carry out joins and data fusion by relying on different schema representations; then, a self-learning black-box cost model is used to estimate execution times and select the most efficient plan. The experiments assess the effectiveness of the cost model in choosing the best execution plan for the given queries and exploit multiple multistore benchmarks to investigate the factors that influence the performance of different plans.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The widespread adoption of the freemium business model together with the introduction of cost-efficient analytics tools have made the use of analytics pervasive in the game industry. While big data and analytics have drawn extensive scholarly attention, the research focusing particularly on game analytics is scant and largely descriptive. Thus, there is a need for research focusing on how game companies employ analytics. In this study, we analyze data collected through a set of in-depth interviews of small and medium-sized freemium game developers. We identify four main roles of game analytics: 1) sense-making device, 2) decision-support system, 3) communication tool, and 4) hygiene factor. We employ the attention-based view of the firm to discuss how these roles diverge and converge in terms of organizational attention. The study advances the research on the roles and business value of analytics in the game and software industry.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The theory of planned behavior (TPB) is popular in social commerce research, but existing studies have yielded inconclusive and inconsistent findings. As TPB was developed before the introduction of the Internet, Web 2.0 technologies, and social media, it is time to evaluate whether its relevance, effectiveness, novelty, and parsimony may have deteriorated due to temporal factors and the emergence of new Information Systems (IS) artifacts. In this work, an extended TPB2 is proposed by integrating social support, and MASEM analysis was conducted using a pooled correlation matrix. The findings revealed that TPB2 can better capture the nature of social commerce, as it can explain 28.4% of the variance in attitude, 59.0% of the variance in behavioral intention, and 9% of the variance in use behavior. In addition, it indicates that masculinity and uncertainty avoidance are the most significant Hofstedian cultural dimensions. The theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed along with the research agenda.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This paper aims to examine the challenges of preventing internal identity theft related crimes (IIDTRC) in the UK retail sector. Using an in-depth multiple case studies of a selected number of cross-functional management teams in the UK retail companies, management roles were analysed. We used semi-structured interview as a qualitative data collection technique and used Nvivo aided thematic analysis and interpretivism underpinned by Role-Based Framework (RBF) for analysis. Our findings revealed that vagueness of roles and lack of clarity in sharing data security responsibilities are the major challenges of preventing IIDTRC in UK retail companies. We suggest an application of RBF which provides a conceptual analysis for cross-functional management team to address the challenges of preventing IIDTRC. RBF enables clarity of shared roles where both information security and crimes prevention teams work in unison is required to prevent IIDTRC to maximise internal data security. Contributions for policymakers are offered in this paper.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing quickly, and systems can increasingly perform a multitude of tasks that previously required human intelligence. Information systems can facilitate collaboration between humans and AI systems such that their individual capabilities complement each other. However, there is a lack of consolidated design guidelines for information systems facilitating the collaboration between humans and AI systems. This work examines how agent transparency affects trust and task outcomes in the context of human-AI collaboration. Drawing on the 3-Gap framework, we study agent transparency as a means to reduce the information asymmetry between humans and the AI. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we formulate testable propositions, derive design requirements, and synthesize design principles. We instantiate two design principles as design features of an information system utilized in the hospitality industry. Further, we conduct two case studies to evaluate the effects of agent transparency: We find that trust increases when the AI system provides information on its reasoning, while trust decreases when the AI system provides information on sources of uncertainty. Additionally, we observe that agent transparency improves task outcomes as it enhances the accuracy of judgemental forecast adjustments.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Intelligence amplification exploits the opportunities of artificial intelligence, which includes data analytic techniques and codified knowledge for increasing the intelligence of human decision makers. Intelligence amplification does not replace human decision makers but may help especially professionals in making complex decisions by well-designed human-AI system learning interactions (i.e., triple loop learning). To understand the adoption challenges of intelligence amplification systems, we analyse the adoption of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) as an organizational learning process by the case of a CDSS implementation for deciding on administering antibiotics to prematurely born babies. We identify user-oriented single and double loop learning processes, triple loop learning, and institutional deutero learning processes as organizational learning processes that must be realized for effective intelligence amplification adoption. We summarize these insights in a system dynamic model—containing knowledge stocks and their transformation processes—by which we analytically structure insights from the diverse studies of CDSS and intelligence amplification adoption and by which intelligence amplification projects are given an analytic theory for their design and management. From our case study, we find multiple challenges of deutero learning that influence the effectiveness of IA implementation learning as transforming tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and explicit knowledge back to tacit knowledge. In a discussion of implications, we generate further research directions and discuss the generalization of our case findings to different organizations.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Intelligent agents (IAs) are permeating both business and society. However, interacting with IAs poses challenges moving beyond technological limitations towards the human-computer interface. Thus, the knowledgebase related to interaction with IAs has grown exponentially but remains segregated and impedes the advancement of the field. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature review to integrate empirical knowledge on user interaction with IAs. This is the first paper to examine 107 Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction papers and identified 389 relationships between design elements and user acceptance of IAs. Along the independent and dependent variables of these relationships, we span a research space model encompassing empirical research on designing for IA user acceptance. Further we contribute to theory, by presenting a research agenda along the dimensions of the research space, which shall be useful to both researchers and practitioners. This complements the past and present knowledge on designing for IA user acceptance with potential pathways into the future of IAs.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Co-production and active participation of the consumers are considered to have enhanced the value co-creation activities that would ensure business benefits of a firm. The marketing literature available does not explicitly explain the philosophy that would motivate the consumers to help to increase values for co-creation activities. In this context, attempts have been made to identify the factors that would impact on co-production and consumers’ participation to co-create values. By studying literature and theories such as theory of co-creation, theory of value creation, information processing theory, marketing theory and expectancy value theory, a conceptual model called F-P-C-B (Future Participation (F) - Co-production (P) - Co-creation (C) - Business Benefit (B)) has been developed along with nine hypotheses. The data was from 362 respondents in India and the model was tested using PLS based analysis. The study shows that it is important for the firms to shift from product-oriented activities to customer-related strategies. It is also found that for obtaining more profitability and better business results, customers should be involved in business activities by way of involving in co-design, idea generation, and other relevant activities of the firms. Moreover, the study highlights that knowledge sharing between the customers and the firm authorities ensures better business values.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Owing to technological advancements in artificial intelligence, voice assistants (VAs) offer speech as a new interaction modality. Compared to text-based interaction, speech is natural and intuitive, which is why companies use VAs in customer service. However, we do not yet know for which kinds of tasks speech is beneficial. Drawing on task-technology fit theory, we present a research model to examine the applicability of VAs to different tasks. To test this model, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 116 participants who had to complete an information search task with a VA or a chatbot. The results show that speech exhibits higher perceived efficiency, lower cognitive effort, higher enjoyment, and higher service satisfaction than text-based interaction. We also find that these effects depend on the task’s goal-directedness. These findings extend task-technology fit theory to customers’ choice of interaction modalities and inform practitioners about the use of VAs for information search tasks.},

In this experimental survey study with open-ended qualitative questions, we examine decision making in six HRM functions and manipulate the decision maker (AI or human) and decision valence (positive or negative) to determine their impact on individuals’ experiences of interactional justice, trust, dehumanization, and perceptions of decision-maker role appropriateness. In terms of decision makers, the use of human decision makers over AIs generally resulted in better perceptions of respectful treatment. In terms of decision valence, people experiencing positive over negative decisions generally resulted in better perceptions of respectful treatment. In instances where these cases conflict, on some indicators people preferred positive AI decisions over negative human decisions. Qualitative responses show how people identify justice concerns with both AI and human decision making. We outline implications for theory, practice, and future research.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Cutting-edge technologies like big data analytics (BDA), artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, blockchain, and digital twins have a profound impact on the sustainability of the production system. In addition, it is argued that turbulence in technology could negatively impact the adoption of these technologies and adversely impact the sustainability of the production system of the firm. The present study has demonstrated that the role of technological turbulence as a moderator could impact the relationships between the sustainability the of production system with its predictors. The study further analyses the mediating role of operational sustainability which could impact the firm performance. A theoretical model has been developed that is underpinned by dynamic capability view (DCV) theory and firm absorptive capacity theory. This model was verified by PLS-SEM with 412 responses from various manufacturing firms in India. There exists a positive and significant influence of AI and other cutting-edge technologies for keeping the production system sustainable.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Competition on e-commerce platforms is becoming increasingly fierce, due to the ease of online searching for comparing products and services. We examine how the sequential browsing behavior of consumers can enable targeted marketing strategies on e-commerce platforms, by using clickstream data from one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Asia. We deploy duration analysis to i) explore how path dependence can better explain consumers’ sequential browsing behavior in different product categories, and ii) characterize the sequential browsing behavior of heterogeneous consumer groups. The findings of our work showcase i) the high accuracy of using sequential browsing path dependence to explain consumer behavior, ii) the patterns of their behavioral intentions and iii) the spell of the behavior of heterogeneous consumer groups. Our findings provide nuanced implications for strategically managing branding, marketing, and customer relations on e-commerce platforms. We discuss the implications of our findings for both research and practice, and we delineate an agenda for future research on the topic.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract E-learning systems are receiving ever increasing attention in academia, business and public administration. Major crises, like the pandemic, highlight the tremendous importance of the appropriate development of e-learning systems and its adoption and processes in organizations. Managers and employees who need efficient forms of training and learning flow within organizations do not have to gather in one place at the same time or to travel far away to attend courses. Contemporary affordances of e-learning systems allow users to perform different jobs or tasks for training courses according to their own scheduling, as well as to collaborate and share knowledge and experiences that result in rich learning flows within organizations. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic review of empirical studies at the intersection of e-learning and organizational learning in order to summarize the current findings and guide future research. Forty-seven peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. This survey identifies five major directions of the research on the confluence of e-learning and organizational learning during the last decade. Future research should leverage big data produced from the platforms and investigate how the incorporation of advanced learning technologies (e.g., learning analytics, personalized learning) can help increase organizational value.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Lack of trust can have a negative influence on consumers’ willingness to use electronic retail (e-tail) platforms especially in countries with weak regulations and poor consumer rights. This paper examined factors that can be employed to build consumer trust and continuance intention to use e-tail platforms in Sub-Saharan Africa. Survey data was collected from 207 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling with the PLS software. The results show that information quality, perceived usefulness, hedonic motivation, and perceived risk have a significant influence on consumers’ trust in e-tail platforms. The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge that guides efforts for the implementation of actions in weak institutional contexts characterized by institutional voids such as those experienced in Sub-Saharan African countries. Finally, the study provides insights that can help managers of e-tail platforms to effectively foster the development of trust in their communities.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The complex and interdependent nature of smart cities raises significant political, technical, and socioeconomic challenges for designers, integrators and organisations involved in administrating these new entities. An increasing number of studies focus on the security, privacy and risks within smart cities, highlighting the threats relating to information security and challenges for smart city infrastructure in the management and processing of personal data. This study analyses many of these challenges, offers a valuable synthesis of the relevant key literature, and develops a smart city interaction framework. The study is organised around a number of key themes within smart cities research: privacy and security of mobile devices and services; smart city infrastructure, power systems, healthcare, frameworks, algorithms and protocols to improve security and privacy, operational threats for smart cities, use and adoption of smart services by citizens, use of blockchain and use of social media. This comprehensive review provides a useful perspective on many of the key issues and offers key direction for future studies.

   abstract                      = {Abstract Work and Employment is a critical area that is undergoing major change influenced by the widespread connectivity and utilisation of the Internet and the rise of digital platforms. Crowdwork is an emerging new way of working that is witnessing exponential growth. It is surrounded by a fixed debate between opposite perspectives on its impact on workers. However, both perspectives adopt a static view that does not pay much attention to crowdworkers’ progress in their job over time. In this study, we seek to advance this debate by adopting a dynamic view of crowdwork to explore the trajectory of workers over time based on their own accounts. Through rich qualitative data and inductive analysis, the study unravels that crowdworkers craft what could be conceptualised as a career development path. It identifies five stages in this career path and workers’ efforts to mould their work demands and job-related resources to create a future for themselves. The discussion shows the fruitful insight that this approach brings to theory and practice. Limitations and future avenues for research are then discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Twitter has become a fertile place for rumors, as information can spread to a large number of people immediately. Rumors can mislead public opinion, weaken social order, decrease the legitimacy of government, and lead to a significant threat to social stability. Therefore, timely detection and debunking rumor are urgently needed. In this work, we proposed an Attention-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that uses tweet text with thirteen different linguistic and user features to distinguish rumor and non-rumor tweets. The performance of the proposed Attention-based LSTM model is compared with several conventional machine and deep learning models. The proposed Attention-based LSTM model achieved an F 1 -score of 0.88 in classifying rumor and non-rumor tweets, which is better than the state-of-the-art results. The proposed system can reduce the impact of rumors on society and weaken the loss of life, money, and build the firm trust of users with social media platforms.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation incorporates challenges that are unique to the context of AI, such as dealing with probabilistic outputs. To address these challenges, recent research suggests that organizations should develop specific capabilities for AI implementation. Currently, we lack a thorough understanding of how certain capabilities facilitate AI implementation. It remains unclear how they help organizations to cope with AI’s unique characteristics. To address this research gap, we employ a qualitative research approach and conduct 25 explorative interviews with experts on AI implementation. We derive four organizational capabilities for AI implementation: AI Project Planning and Co-Development help to cope with the inscrutability in AI, which complicates the planning of AI projects and communication between different stakeholders. Data Management and AI Model Lifecycle Management help to cope with the data dependency in AI, which challenges organizations to provide the proper data foundation and continuously adjust AI systems as the data evolves. We contribute to our understanding of the sociotechnical implications of AI’s characteristics and further develop the concept of organizational capabilities as an important success factor for AI implementation. For practice, we provide actionable recommendations to develop organizational capabilities for AI implementation.},

The paper focuses on causal ML/AI models for campaign targeting. Such models estimate the change in customer behavior due to a marketing action known as the individual treatment effect (ITE) or uplift. ITE estimates capture the value of a marketing action when applied to a specific customer and facilitate effective and efficient targeting. We consolidate uplift models for multiple treatments and continuous outcomes and perform a benchmarking study to demonstrate their potential to target promotional monetary campaigns. In this use case, the new models facilitate selecting the optimal discount amount to offer to a customer. Large-scale analysis based on eight marketing data sets from leading B2C retailers confirms the significant gains in the campaign return on marketing when using the new models compared to relevant model benchmarks and conventional marketing practices.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Anecdotal evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are highly effective in digital marketing and rapidly growing in popularity in the context of business-to-business (B2B) marketing. Yet empirical research on AI-powered B2B marketing, and particularly on the socio-technical aspects of its use, is sparse. This study uses Activity Theory (AT) as a theoretical lens to examine AI-powered B2B marketing as a collective activity system, and to illuminate the contradictions that emerge when adopting and implementing AI into traditional B2B marketing practices. AT is appropriate in the context of this study, as it shows how contradictions act as a motor for change and lead to transformational changes, rather than viewing tensions as a threat to prematurely abandon the adoption and implementation of AI in B2B marketing. Based on eighteen interviews with industry and academic experts, the study identifies contradictions with which marketing researchers and practitioners must contend. We show that these contradictions can be culturally or politically challenging to confront, and even when resolved, can have both intended and unintended consequences.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Today’s companies rely heavily on in-company information technology standards (ICITS) to reduce costs, ensure flexibility, and facilitate the planning, implementation, and operation of IT systems. Steering and managing ICITS has proven to be challenging, revealing the need for efficient governance mechanisms. But even though prior research demonstrates the challenges of ICITS, viable advice on how to implement ICITS is scarce. In this paper, we develop an organizational design theory for the management of ICITS based on the framework of organizational control theory. We conducted a critical case study to identify basic goals, constitutive elements, and fundamental mechanisms of a working ICITS management. The resulting design goals and principles were then evaluated and further refined in the light of additional expert interviews. With our work, we wish to extend the body of theoretical knowledge on the management of ICITS and help practitioners master the various challenges occurring in this domain.},

Consequently, we build on cultural lag theory to analyze how technological changes affect work in software development. We present the results from a series of expert interviews that were analyzed using the Gioia method. Moreover, we identify a set of technology trends pertinent to software development from which we derive four main changes affecting the future of work in software development: (1) a shift toward scalable solutions, (2) increased emphasis on data, (3) convergence of IT and non-IT industries, and (4) the cloud as the dominant computing paradigm. Accordingly, this study contains insights into how technology (as an element of material culture) influences non-material culture, as exemplified by the work involved in software development.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain are the two disruptive technologies emerging from the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) that have introduced radical shifts in the industry. The amalgamation of AI and blockchain holds tremendous potential to create new business models enabled through digitalization. Although research on the application and convergence of AI and blockchain exists, our understanding of the utility of its integration for business remains fragmented. To address this gap, this study aims to characterize the applications and benefits of integrated AI and blockchain platforms across different verticals of business. Using bibliometric analysis, this study reveals the most influential articles on the subject based on their publications, citations, and importance in the intellectual network. Using content analysis, this study sheds light on the subject’s intellectual structure, which is underpinned by four major thematic clusters focusing on supply chains, healthcare, secure transactions, and finance and accounting. The study concludes with 10 application areas in business that can benefit from these technologies.},

They unify and integrate several technological approaches, including big data analysis and artificial intelligence, enhancing real-time monitoring and control of manufacturing processes. An extensive knowledge base formed by various disciplines, including information systems, engineering, and computer science, already exists for CPS. However, this knowledge has not been holistically captured and structured to date. To address this research gap, this study conducts a large-scale literature review of 2365 papers representing the current state of the research and then develops a novel categorization on industrial CPS with 10 sections, 32 areas, and 246 fields. The categorization is presented in hierarchical graphical form and can also be utilized as a web tool. To conclude, a perspective on future research needs and potentials to enhance Industry 4.0 in both research and practice are offered.},

The resulting paradigm shift, referred to as Industry 4.0, impacts manufacturing processes and business models. While the ‘why’ and ‘what’ of Industry 4.0 have been extensively researched, the ‘how’ remains poorly understood. Manufacturers struggle with exploiting Industry 4.0’s full potential as a holistic understanding of required Information Systems (IS) capabilities is missing. To foster such understanding, we present a holistic IS capability framework for Industry 4.0, including primary and support capabilities. After developing the framework based on a structured literature review, we refined and evaluated it with ten Industry 4.0 experts from research and practice. We demonstrated its use with a German machinery manufacturer. In sum, we contribute to understanding and analysing IS capabilities for Industry 4.0. Our work serves as a foundation for further theorising on Industry 4.0 and for deriving theory-led design recommendations for manufacturers.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The Intentional Analytics Model (IAM) has been recently envisioned as a new paradigm to couple OLAP and analytics. It relies on two basic ideas: (i) letting the user explore data by expressing her analysis intentions rather than the data she needs, and (ii) returning enhanced cubes, i.e., multidimensional data annotated with knowledge insights in the form of interesting model components (e.g., clusters). In this paper we contribute to give a proof-of-concept for the IAM vision by delivering an end-to-end implementation of , one of the five intention operators introduced by IAM. Among the research challenges left open in IAM, those we address are (i) automatically tuning the size of models (e.g., the number of clusters), (ii) devising a measure to estimate the interestingness of model components, (iii) selecting the most effective chart or graph for visualizing each enhanced cube depending on its features, and (iv) devising a visual metaphor to display enhanced cubes and interact with them. We assess the validity of our approach in terms of user effort for formulating intentions, effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Computing path queries such as the shortest path in public transport networks is challenging because the path costs between nodes change over time. A reachability query from a node at a given start time on such a network retrieves all points of interest (POIs) that are reachable within a given cost budget. Reachability queries are essential building blocks in many applications, for example, group recommendations, ranking spatial queries, or geomarketing. We propose an efficient solution for reachability queries in public transport networks. Currently, there are two options to solve reachability queries. (1) Execute a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm that supports time-dependent edge traversal costs; this solution is slow since it must expand edge by edge and does not use an index. (2) Issue a separate path query for each single POI, i.e., a single reachability query requires answering many path queries. None of these solutions scales to large networks with many POIs. We propose a novel and lightweight reachability index. The key idea is to partition the network into cells. Then, in contrast to other approaches, we expand the network cell by cell. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world networks confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of our index-based reachability query solution.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The rapid development of e-commerce has led to a swiftly increasing number of competing providers in electronic markets, which maintain their own, individual data describing the offered items. Recommender systems are popular and powerful tools relying on this data to guide users to their individually best item choice. Literature suggests that data quality of item content data has substantial influence on recommendation quality. Thereby, the dimension completeness is expected to be particularly important. Herein resides a considerable chance to improve recommendation quality by increasing completeness via extending an item content data set with an additional data set of the same domain. This paper therefore proposes a procedure for such a systematic data extension and analyzes effects of the procedure regarding items, content and users based on real-world data sets from four leading web portals. The evaluation results suggest that the proposed procedure is indeed effective in enabling improved recommendation quality.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Software-as-a-service applications are experiencing immense growth as their comparatively low cost makes them an important alternative to traditional software. Following the initial adoption phase, vendors are now concerned with the continued usage of their software. To analyze the influence of different measures to improve continued usage over time, a longitudinal study approach using data from a SaaS vendor was implemented. Employing a linear mixed model, the study finds several measures to have a positive effect on a software’s usage penetration. In addition to these activation measures performed by the SaaS vendor, software as well as client characteristics were also examined, but did not display significant estimates. The findings emphasize the need for proactive activation initiatives to raise usage penetration. More generally, the study contributes novel insights into the scarcely researched field of influencing factors on SaaS usage continuance.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Much of the existing scholarly debate on sharing economy to date has focused on the use of technology in developed countries. However, the recent upsurge of mobile technology adoption in developing countries has provided suitable breeding ground for sharing economy. The lack of native theories in tourism and hospitality sector with scare utilization of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) provide necessity for this research. This study adapted meta-UTAUT model as theoretical lens and extended the model with hedonic motivation, trust, and self-efficacy. Based on data from 301 potential Indian consumers, the results underscored the central role of attitude that significantly mediated the effects of effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions on consumer intention to use Airbnb. Meanwhile, performance expectancy emerged as significant direct determinant of intention alongside attitude, trust, and self-efficacy. The proposed model explained as much as 65% variance on Indian consumer’s intention to use Airbnb.},

Using an online survey, we collected data from 464 female participants who are following luxury fashion brands on major social networking sites including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. Results using PLS revealed that SMMa positively influences community engagement and lovemark. Moreover, we find positive relationships between community engagement, lovemark and brand loyalty. However, we find that SMMa has no direct influence on brand loyalty.},

Moderators on social media platforms need to be technologically supported to detect problematic content and react accordingly. In this article, we develop and discuss the design principles that are best suited for creating efficient user interfaces for decision support systems that use artificial intelligence (AI) to assist human moderators. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated various design options over three design cycles with a total of 641 participants. Besides measuring perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use, we also conducted an experiment to prove the significant influence of AI explainability on end users’ perceived cognitive efforts, perceived informativeness, mental model, and trustworthiness in AI. Finally, we tested the acquired design knowledge with software developers, who rated the reusability of the proposed design principles as high.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This study explores the factors that influence the dissemination process of and public susceptibility to fake news amidst COVID-19. By adopting a qualitative approach that draws on 21 interviews with social media users from the standpoint of source credibility and construal level theories, our findings highlight motives of news sharers, platform features, and source credibility/relatedness as major factors influencing the dissemination of and public susceptibility to fake news. The paper further argues that public susceptibility to fake news can be mitigated by building an integrated approach that combines a tripartite strategy from an individual, institutional and platform level. For example, educating the public on digital resilience and enhancing awareness around source credibility can help individuals and institutions reflect on news authenticity and report fake news where possible. This study contributes to fake news literature by integrating concepts from information management, consumer behaviour, influencer marketing and mindfulness to propose a model to help authorities identify and understand the key factors that influence susceptibility to fake news during a public crisis such as COVID-19.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Information technologies exist to enable us to either do things we have not done before or do familiar things more efficiently. Metaverse (i.e. extended reality: XR) enables novel forms of engrossing telepresence, but it also may make mundate tasks more effortless. Such technologies increasingly facilitate our work, education, healthcare, consumption and entertainment; however, at the same time, metaverse bring a host of challenges. Therefore, we pose the question whether XR technologies, specifically Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), either increase or decrease the difficulties of carrying out everyday tasks. In the current study we conducted a 2 (AR: with vs. without) × 2 (VR: with vs. without) between-subject experiment where participants faced a shopping-related task (including navigating, movement, hand-interaction, information processing, information searching, storing, decision making, and simple calculation) to examine a proposed series of hypotheses. The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was used to measure subjective workload when using an XR-mediated information system including six sub-dimensions of frustration, performance, effort, physical, mental, and temporal demand . The findings indicate that AR was significantly associated with overall workload, especially mental demand and effort, while VR had no significant effect on any workload sub-dimensions. There was a significant interaction effect between AR and VR on physical demand, effort, and overall workload. The results imply that the resources and cost of operating XR-mediated realities are different and higher than physical reality.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Fake news (FN) on social media (SM) rose to prominence in 2016 during the United States of America presidential election, leading people to question science, true news (TN), and societal norms. FN is increasingly affecting societal values, changing opinions on critical issues and topics as well as redefining facts, truths, and beliefs. To understand the degree to which FN has changed society and the meaning of FN, this study proposes a novel conceptual framework derived from the literature on FN, SM, and societal acceptance theory. The conceptual framework is developed into a meta-framework that analyzes survey data from 356 respondents. This study explored fuzzy set-theoretic comparative analysis; the outcomes of this research suggest that societies are split on differentiating TN from FN. The results also show splits in societal values. Overall, this study provides a new perspective on how FN on SM is disintegrating societies and replacing TN with FN.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract We explore whether training protocols can enhance the ability of social media users to detect fake news, by conducting an online experiment ( N = 417) to analyse the effect of such a training protocol, while considering the role of scepticism, age, and level of education. Our findings show a significant relationship between the training protocol and the ability of social media users to detect fake news, suggesting that the protocol can play a positive role in training social media users to recognize fake news. Moreover, we find a direct positive relationship between age and level of education on the one hand and ability to detect fake news on the other, which has implications for future research. We demonstrate the potential of training protocols in countering the effects of fake news, as a scalable solution that empowers users and addresses concerns about the time-consuming nature of fact-checking.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The first few months of 2020 have profoundly changed the way we live our lives and carry out our daily activities. Although the widespread use of futuristic robotaxis and self-driving commercial vehicles has not yet become a reality, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different fields. We have witnessed the equivalent of two years of digital transformation compressed into just a few months. Whether it is in tracing epidemiological peaks or in transacting contactless payments, the impact of these developments has been almost immediate, and a window has opened up on what is to come. Here we analyze and discuss how AI can support us in facing the ongoing pandemic. Despite the numerous and undeniable contributions of AI, clinical trials and human skills are still required. Even if different strategies have been developed in different states worldwide, the fight against the pandemic seems to have found everywhere a valuable ally in AI, a global and open-source tool capable of providing assistance in this health emergency. A careful AI application would enable us to operate within this complex scenario involving healthcare, society and research.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Two players strike balances between allocating resources for defense and production of zero-day exploits. Production is further allocated into cyberattack or stockpiling. Applying the Cobb Douglas expected utility function for equivalent players, an analytical solution is determined where each player’s expected utility is inverse U shaped in each player’s unit defense cost. More generally, simulations illustrate the impact of varying nine parameter values relative to a benchmark. Increasing a player’s unit costs of defense or development of zero-days benefits the opposing player. Increasing the contest intensities over the two players’ assets causes the players to increase their efforts until their resources are fully exploited and they receive zero expected utility. Decreasing the Cobb Douglas output elasticity for a player’s stockpiling of zero-days causes its attack to increase and its expected utility to eventually reach a maximum, while the opposing player’s expected utility reaches a minimum. Altering the Cobb Douglas output elasticities for a player’s attack or defense contests towards their maxima or minima causes maximum expected utility for both players.},

The conceptual model was proposed using theories including the social support theory, the trust theory, the social presence theory, the flow theory and the service-dominant logic theory. Using Facebook online community, the data were collected from 400 respondents from Jordan and analysed using AMOS based structural equation modelling. Results revealed that social commerce constructs positively influence social support, community members’ trust and social presence. Furthermore, it was found that social support and social presence positively affect community members’ trust. We also found that community members’ trust positively influence flow whereas both community members’ trust and flow positively influence community engagement.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Social media has played a pivotal role in polarising views on politics, climate change, and more recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Social media induced polarisation (SMIP) poses serious challenges to society as it could enable ‘digital wildfires’ that can wreak havoc worldwide. While the effects of SMIP have been extensively studied, there is limited understanding of the interplay between two key components of this phenomenon: confirmation bias (reinforcing one’s attitudes and beliefs) and echo chambers (i.e., hear their own voice). This paper addresses this knowledge deficit by exploring how manifestations of confirmation bias contributed to the development of ‘echo chambers’ at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis of data collected from 35 participants involved in supply chain information processing forms the basis of a conceptual model of SMIP and four key cross-cutting propositions emerging from the data that have implications for research and practice.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Following the growing popularity of social commerce sites, there is an increased interest in understanding how consumers decide what products to purchase based on the available information. Consumers nowadays are confronted with the task of assessing marketer-generated (MGC) as well as user-generated information (UGC) in a range of different forms to make informed purchase-related decisions. This study examines the information types and forms that influence consumers in their decision-making process on social commerce. Building on uses and gratifications and dual-process theories, we distinguish between marketer and user generated content, and differentiate formats into informational and normative. Using a mixed methods approach that builds on an eye-tracking study, followed by semi-structured interviews with 23 participants, our results indicate significant differences in the types and format of information consumed for selected versus eliminated products. Specifically, we looked at engagement, cognitive processing, and observation of consumers, since they reveal information about the mental and processing mechanisms during decision making. We find that consumers present a number of differences in terms of these measures among the different types of content, and with respect to selected versus eliminated products. The outcomes of the interviews also serve to complement these findings, providing more detailed information about the processes and emotional states of consumers during the selection process.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Mitigating misinformation on social media is an unresolved challenge, particularly because of the complexity of information dissemination. To this end, Multivariate Hawkes Processes (MHP) have become a fundamental tool because they model social network dynamics, which facilitates execution and evaluation of mitigation policies. In this paper, we propose a novel light-weight intervention-based misinformation mitigation framework using decentralized Learning Automata (LA) to control the MHP. Each automaton is associated with a single user and learns to what degree that user should be involved in the mitigation strategy by interacting with a corresponding MHP, and performing a joint random walk over the state space. We use three Twitter datasets to evaluate our approach, one of them being a new COVID-19 dataset provided in this paper. Our approach shows fast convergence and increased valid information exposure. These results persisted independently of network structure, including networks with central nodes, where the latter could be the root of misinformation . Further, the LA obtained these results in a decentralized manner, facilitating distributed deployment in real-life scenarios.},

This article aims at providing a systematic overview of the current state of the emerging research field of Universal Design of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Emergency Management, and to highlight high-impact research opportunities to ensure that the increasing introduction of ICT in Emergency Management can contribute to removing barriers instead of adding more barriers, in particular for the elderly and people with disabilities. A systematic review on relevant literature on Universal Design, ICT and Emergency Management between 2008 and 2020 was employed using predefined frameworks, to answer the following questions: (1) Who are the target audiences (stakeholders) in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency Management in the different categories of Emergency Management ICT tools, and to what degree is Human-Centred Design and Universal Design taken into account? (2) What are the most important challenges and gaps in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency Management? We identify a set of gaps in the literature, indicating that there are some challenges where Universal Design is still limitedly addressed in technology development. We also derive promising future research topics based on areas that are missing in the literature.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Social media has become an important channel of communication in emergency and disaster management. Emergency Management Agencies can distribute helpful and important information to the general public and also gather information to enrich their management efforts. This, however, remains challenging since several communication-related barriers occur. This study investigates how the concept of Nudging, a form of behaviour adjustment, can be applied to address these barriers. A Systematic Literature Review and qualitative social media data analysis methods were applied to explore the potential of digital nudges on social media. Twelve forms of digital nudges could be identified in the data that influenced the visibility of the messages they occurred in. The results suggest that Digital Nudging on Social Media is a promising approach to use in emergency and disaster communication.},

This study located UTAUT2 based empirical studies in the Scopus and Web of Science bibliographic database through citied reference search in order to evaluate appropriate usage of UTAUT2 constructs. The meta-analysis results spanning across 60 studies with more than 122,000 cumulative observations found BI➔UB as the strongest path with all significant values. PE➔BI emerged as the most utilized path with most significant values underscoring the emphasis placed by consumers on utilitarian value. Meanwhile, with most non-significant path values the future usage of EE➔BI path is been cautioned and questioned. Finally, trust, personal innovativeness, perceived risk, attitude, and self-efficacy were found as the five topmost UTAUT2 extensions.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract With the overnight growth in Working from Home (WFH) owing to the pandemic, organisations and their employees have had to adapt work-related processes and practices quickly with a huge reliance upon technology. Everyday activities such as social interactions with colleagues must therefore be reconsidered. Existing literature emphasises that social interactions, typically conducted in the traditional workplace, are a fundamental feature of social life and shape employees’ experience of work. This experience is completely removed for many employees due to the pandemic and, presently, there is a lack of knowledge on how individuals maintain social interactions with colleagues via technology when working from home. Given that a lack of social interaction can lead to social isolation and other negative repercussions, this study aims to contribute to the existing body of literature on remote working by highlighting employees’ experiences and practices around social interaction with colleagues. This study takes an interpretivist and qualitative approach utilising the diary-keeping technique to collect data from twenty-nine individuals who had started to work from home on a full-time basis as a result of the pandemic. The study explores how participants conduct social interactions using different technology platforms and how such interactions are embedded in their working lives. The findings highlight the difficulty in maintaining social interactions via technology such as the absence of cues and emotional intelligence, as well as highlighting numerous other factors such as job uncertainty, increased workloads and heavy usage of technology that affect their work lives. The study also highlights that despite the negative experiences relating to working from home, some participants are apprehensive about returning to work in the traditional office place where social interactions may actually be perceived as a distraction. The main contribution of our study is to highlight that a variety of perceptions and feelings of how work has changed via an increased use of digital media while working from home exists and that organisations need to be aware of these differences so that they can be managed in a contextualised manner, thus increasing both the efficiency and effectiveness of working from home.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Technical progress is disrupting the mobility sector. New door-to-door (D2D) mobility integrators promise to offer smart mobility by packaging together different mobility services such as car-sharing and public transport. However, mobility providers up to now have rarely entered into value co-creation relationships. As a result, citizens are offered mobility that cannot be considered truly smart. Although value co-creation has been the subject of numerous studies taking the service-dominant logic perspective, this research has often lacked empirical evidence. To close this gap, we conceptualize value co-creation between mobility providers and a D2D mobility integrator by applying Activity Theory. Based on a qualitative study in the German mobility sector, we identify several inhibitors of value co-creation from the viewpoint of mobility providers. In addition, we show how these inhibitors serve as triggers for adaptations, ultimately leading to the formation of a value co-creation relationship.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This study aims to address a research gap related to the outcomes of the use of technology when the performance falls short of initial expectations, and the coping mechanisms that users may deploy in such circumstances. By adopting Cognitive Dissonance Theory, the objectives of the study are a) to examine how dissonance, caused by the negative disconfirmation of expectations, may translate into a positive outcome and b) study how negative emotions, such as anger, guilt and regret, determine the selection of the mechanism to reduce dissonance. The theorised model was tested using a cross-sectional research design and a sample of 387 smart home users. The focus on smart home users fitted the objectives of the study due to the high expectations that users form and the challenges that the utilisation of technology sometimes causes. The collected data was analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings indicate that post-disconfirmation dissonance induces feelings of anger, guilt and regret, correlating with dissonance reduction mechanisms, which in turn have a distinctive effect on satisfaction and wellbeing. The findings of the study contribute to the discussion on expectation-disconfirmation and cognitive dissonance, by illustrating the interrelationship between emotional, cognitive and behavioural factors following the evaluation of technology performance and confirming that negative disconfirmation may result in satisfaction.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract As a new revolution of Ubiquitous Computing and Internet of Things, multimodal wearable intelligence technique is rapidly becoming a new research topic in both academic and industrial fields. Owning to the rapid spread of wearable and mobile devices, this technique is evolving healthcare from traditional hub-based systems to more personalised healthcare systems. This trend is well-aligned with recent “Healthcare 4.0” which is a continuous process of transforming the entire healthcare value chain to be preventive, precise, predictive and personalised, with significant benefits to elder care. But empowering the utility of multimodal wearable intelligence technique for elderly care like people with dementia is significantly challenging considering many issues, such as shortage of cost-effective wearable sensors, heterogeneity of wearable devices connected, high demand for interoperability, etc. Focusing on these challenges, this paper gives a systematic review of advanced multimodal wearable intelligence technologies for dementia care in Healthcare 4.0. One framework is proposed for reviewing the current research of wearable intelligence, and key enabling technologies, major applications, and successful case studies in dementia care, and finally points out future research trends and challenges in Healthcare 4.0.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This paper examines the affordances of Reddit , a digital media platform where Users share and discuss content. The aim of the study was to understand the affordances of Reddit, and how the affordances of Reddit through various features of the platform lead to outcomes, specifically those relating to political loyalty and the creation of political narratives. The study contributes an insight into the evolution and understanding of affordances as a result of examining the ways in which individuals who were previously members of another political group constructed narratives around switching their support to the Trump campaign in the 2016 US presidential elections. The study specifically focusses on an exclusive membership community called r/ The_Donald . As a result of analysing posts on common themes using Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA), we conclude that the features enable membership of a community to be rewarded, switched or denied. As a result, this study has identified five affordances of Reddit, which include credibility, expressing oneself freely, echoing beliefs, creating membership and the meta-affordance ‘Redpilling’. The outcomes of these affordances are that ingroups are created, support can be switched, extreme or hateful views are legitimised and a new brand of conservatism is given credibility. This in turn is concluded to have realised impacts outside of the virtual environment in this case on the self-reported behaviours of voters.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Extant academic research provides a comprehensive view of online consumer behaviour on a single website, paying less attention to the integrated environment in which websites operate. Retailers’ products, however, are not only available on their own website, but also through other connected channels such as comparison sites. Our limited knowledge of consumers’ integrated behaviour across the entire market poses difficulties to design effective online strategies. At the same time, practitioners have mainly focused on website performance measures, ignoring the reasons behind the behaviour of consumers. A deeper understanding of consumers who visit different websites or, cross-visit, can inform successful online channel strategies. This macro-level study aims to bridge this gap by investigating how the usage behaviour on retailers’ websites and comparison sites influences each other, using large-scale industry-based data. A new measure of ‘cross-visiting’ behaviour is introduced and examined.},

However, when people engage with technologies in their everyday lives, they not only enact the material attributes of the artifact but also draw on their skills, social positions, prior experience and societal norms and expectations to make use of the artifact. Drawing on Orlikowski’s analytical framework of “technologies-in-practice” we engage in an interview-based exploratory study among diverse groups of users in urban India to understand use of VUIs as situated practice. We identify three technologies-in-practice emerging through enactment of VUIs on users’ smartphones: looking up, learning and leisure. We argue that – instead of asking why and how users appropriate VUIs – identifying different kinds of enactments of VUIs present researchers and practitioners with a more nuanced understanding of existing and potential use of VUIs across varied contexts.},

However, preserving the privacy in IoT and Industrial 4.0 against re-identification attacks is very challenging. In this work, we considered three main data types generated in IoT: context data , continuous data , and media data . We first proposed a stream data anonymisation method based on k -anonymity for data collected by IoT devices; and then privacy enhancing techniques for both continuous data and media data were proposed for different IoT scenarios. The experiment results show that the proposed techniques can well preserve privacy without significantly affecting the utility of the data.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Addiction in the context of information technology gained increased public interest within the last years. Only recently, companies like Apple, Google, and Instagram announced to fight smartphone addiction and integrated matching features in their systems. However, if and how these features really help is still an open question. At present, there is only a very rudimentary understanding of IT-triggered disorders and addictions in information systems. Even in clinical research, there is no consensus on the nature of these addictions yet. Nevertheless, the omnipresence of information technology in our daily lives and its unpredictable effects on our moods require this problem to be addressed in a profound manner. This paper links findings from psychology and neuroscience to the information systems terminology and derives the Four-Component Model for Non-addictive Information Systems (4-NAIS). The 4-NAIS allows locating how information technology interacts with the reinforcement cycle of addictions and provides a deeper understanding of where interventions and design decisions may really help tackle IT-triggered disorders.},

Based on the alignment level analysis with the Good AI Society’s framework and sentiment analysis of official tweets, the diagnostic analysis resulted in contrastive findings for the two applications. While the application EHTERAZ (Arabic for precaution) in Qatar has fallen short in adhering to the responsible AI requirements, it has contributed significantly to controlling the pandemic. On the other hand, the UK’s NHS COVID-19 application has exhibited limited success in fighting the virus despite relatively abiding by these requirements. This underlines the need for obtaining a practical and contextual view for a comprehensive discourse on responsible AI in healthcare. Thereby offering necessary guidance for striking a balance between responsible AI requirements and managing pressures towards fighting the pandemic.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The Healthcare sector has been at the forefront of the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Owing to the nature of the services and the vulnerability of a large section of end-users, the topic of responsible AI has become the subject of widespread study and discussion. We conduct a mixed-method study to identify the constituents of responsible AI in the healthcare sector and investigate its role in value formation and market performance. The study context is India, where AI technologies are in the developing phase. The results from 12 in-depth interviews enrich the more nuanced understanding of how different facets of responsible AI guide healthcare firms in evidence-based medicine and improved patient centered care. PLS-SEM analysis of 290 survey responses validates the theoretical framework and establishes responsible AI as a third-order factor. The 174 dyadic data findings also confirm the mediation mechanism of the patient’s cognitive engagement with responsible AI-solutions and perceived value, which leads to market performance.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Organisations are increasingly creating inter-organisational ecosystem partnerships to innovate openly. Despite effective knowledge management significantly supporting ecosystem infrastructures, empirical insights into the importance of and interdependencies between conditions for successful knowledge exchange across ecosystem contexts remain unexplored within existing literature. This study implements a mixed-method approach to ascertain which conditions are responsible for knowledge transfer success across innovation ecosystems. Interpretive Structural Modelling was employed to analyse questionnaires with key ecosystem stakeholders, in order to impose a hierarchical structure upon the conditions. The configurational nature of these conditions, and their combinations into solutions for success was ascertained through analysing semi-structured interviews using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Results reveal multiple, mutually exclusive pathways to knowledge transfer success, grouped into three solution types, increasing understanding of the interrelated nature of the knowledge transfer conditions. Limitations and implications for future research are provided.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract While many data-driven businesses have seen rapid growth in recent years, their business development might be highly contingent upon data protection regulation. While it is often claimed that stricter regulation penalizes firms, there is only scarce empirical evidence for this. We therefore study how data protection regulation affects startup innovation, exploring this question during the ongoing introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our results show that the effects of data protection regulation on startup innovation are complex: it simultaneously stimulates and constrains innovation. We identify six distinct firm responses to the effects of the GDPR; three that stimulate innovation, and three that constrain it. We furthermore identify two key stipulations in the GDPR that account for the most important innovation constraints. Implications and potential policy responses are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The emergence of a preventive cybersecurity paradigm that aims to eliminate the sources of cybercrime threats is becoming an increasingly necessary complement to the current self-defensive cybersecurity systems. One concern associated with adopting such preventive measures is the risk of privacy infringement. Therefore, it is necessary to design the future Internet infrastructure so that it can appropriately balance preventive cybersecurity measures with privacy protections. This research proposes to design the Internet infrastructure using the preventive cybersecurity measures of the Bright Internet, namely preventive cybersecurity protocol and identifiable anonymity protocol , and ten privacy rights derived from Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). We then analyze the legitimacy of the five steps of the preventive cybersecurity protocol and the four features of the identifiable anonymity protocol from the perspectives of ten privacy rights. We address the legitimacy from the perspective of potential victims’ self-defense rights. Finally, we discuss four potential risks that may occur to the innocent senders and proposed resilient recovery procedures.},

However, existing smart devices like smartphones and tablets are difficult to use at the point of care, because health care professionals require both hands during their work. Following a design science research approach including ethnographic fieldwork and prototype tests with focus groups, we find that Augmented Reality smart glass applications offer potential for service innovation in the health care sector. Our smart glass prototype supports health care professionals during wound treatment by allowing them to document procedures hands-free while they perform them. Furthermore, we investigate the use of audio based and physical interaction with the smart glasses in a within-subjects design experiment.},

By using the findings from 69 studies, this research identified best (e.g. argument quality, valence, eWOM usefulness, trust in message), promising (e.g. eWOM credibility, emotional trust, attitude towards website) and least effective (e.g. volume, existing eWOM, source credibility) predictors of intention to buy in eWOM research. Additionally, the effect size of each predictor was calculated by performing meta-analysis. For academics, understanding what influences consumers’ intention to buy will help set the agenda for future research directions; for practitioners, it will provide benefit in terms of practical guidance based on detailed analysis of specific factors influencing consumers’ intention to buy, which could enhance their marketing activities.},

We deploy a data/frame model to study this process and investigate resistance-related reactions and the deployment of accommodating practices at the individual level. Analyzing user blogs that provide narratives on user interaction with tablets, we identify triggers of episodes of disillusionment and illustrate five sensemaking paths that users follow, eventually leading to one of three practices: 1) users choose to defer tasks until the situation changes, or they abandon the platform altogether; 2) they develop workarounds at different levels of proficiency; or 3) they proceed by reframing their expectations of the platform. By revealing user decision-making process during episodes of disillusionment, the findings contribute to information systems post-adoption research. At a practical level, the findings inform IT artifact and application design by offering insights on how users process discrepancies between their expectations and actual use experience.},

The research answered the question of what capabilities are required to shape the exploitation of digital innovation, namely market offerings and the digital business process. To address the research question with a quantitative research method, data were collected through survey questionnaires distributed among 280 SMEs operating in the service and manufacturing industries in Finland. The results revealed that among four digital-related capabilities—namely human, collaboration, technical, and innovation capabilities—human, technical, and innovation capabilities contribute to market offerings, while human, collaboration, and technical capabilities contribute to the business process.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Organizations often adopt enterprise architecture (EA) when planning how best to develop their information technology (IT) or businesses, for strategic management, or generally for managing change initiatives. This variety of different uses affects many stakeholders within and between organizations. Because stakeholders have dissimilar backgrounds, positions, assumptions, and activities, they respond differently to changes and the potential problems that emerge from those changes. This situation creates contradictions and conflicts between stakeholders that may further influence project activities and ultimately determine how EA is adopted. In this paper, we examine how institutional pressures influence EA adoption. Based on a qualitative case study of two cases, we show how regulative, normative, and cognitive pressures influence stakeholders’ activities and behaviors during the process of EA adoption. Our contribution thus lies in identifying roles of institutional pressures in different phases during the process of EA adoption and how it changes overtime. The results provide insights into EA adoption and the process of institutionalization, which help to explain emergent challenges in EA adoption.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Agile development methodologies (ADM) have become a widely implemented project management approach in Information Systems (IS). Yet, along with its growing popularity, the amount of concerns raised in regard to human related challenges caused by applying ADM are rapidly increasing. Nevertheless, the extant scholarly literature has neglected to identify the primary origins and reasons of these challenges. The purpose of this study is therefore to examine if these human related challenges are related to a lack of Emotional Intelligence (EI) by means of a quantitative approach. From a sample of 194 agile practitioners, EI was found to be significantly correlated to human related challenges in agile teams in terms of anxiety, motivation, mutual trust and communication competence. Hence, these findings offer important new knowledge for IS-scholars, project managers and human resource practitioners, about the vital role of EI for staffing and training of agile managed IS-projects.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Information systems (IS) should be infused into individuals’ work activities for organizations to extract value from these systems. Studies have identified various factors that impact IS infusion, but few have examined the importance of individuals’ identities and the role of contextual factors. Drawing on identity and status characteristics theories, this study conceptualizes individuals’ material identity as IT identity, and role identity as IS infusion role identity and examines their relationships and effects on IS infusion as well as the role status characteristics play in shaping these relationships. The models were evaluated using survey data collected from enterprise systems users. Findings suggest that individuals’ IT identity shape IS infusion role identity, and together, these identities influence their IS infusion. Additionally, work-related and personal characteristics strengthen the relationships between identities and IS infusion. This study highlights the role of individual’s IT and role identities and status characteristics in fostering IS infusion.},

   abstract                      = {Modern service-based processes in mobile environments are highly complex due to the necessary spatial–temporal coordination between multiple participating users and the consideration of context information. Due to the dynamic nature of mobile environments, disruptive events occur at runtime, which require a re-selection of the planned service compositions respecting multiple users and context-awareness. Thereby, when re-selecting services the features performance, solution quality, solution robustness and alternative solutions are essential and contribute to the efficacy of service systems. This paper presents an optimization-based heuristic technique based on a stateful representation that uses a region-based approach to re-select services considering multiple users, context information and in particular disruptive events at runtime. The evaluation results, which are based on a real-world scenario from the tourism domain, show that the proposed heuristic is superior compared to competing artifacts.},

   abstract                      = {Features extraction has a fundamental value in enhancing the scalability and adaptability n of medical image processing framework. The outcome of this stage has a tremendous effect on the reliability of the medical application being developed, particularly disease classification and prediction. The challenging side of features extraction frameworks, in relation to medical images, is influenced by the anatomical and morphological structure of the image which requires a powerful extraction system that highlights high- and low- level features. The complementary of both feature types reinforces the medical image content-based retrieval and allows to access visible structures as well as an in-depth understanding of related deep hidden components. Several existing techniques have been used towards extracting high- and low-level features separately, including Deep Learning based approaches. However, the fusion of these features remains a challenging task. Towards tackling the drawback caused by the lack of features combination and enhancing the reliability of features extraction methods, this paper proposes a new hybrid features extraction framework that focuses on the fusion and optimal selection of high- and low-level features. The scalability and reliability of the proposed method is achieved by the automated adjustment of the final optimal features based on real-time scenarios resulting an accurate and efficient medical images disease classification. The proposed framework has been tested on two different datasets to include BraTS and Retinal sets achieving an accuracy rate of 97% and 98.9%, respectively.},

   abstract                      = {This paper focuses on the effects of gender diversity – in terms of binary- and third-gender – on social media engagement (SMEn). Specifically, we examine the extent to which SMEn's antecedents and outcomes vary between binary- and third-gender people. Based on the uses and gratification theory (UGT) , we develop and validate a model using two cross-sectional studies. Data have been collected from heterosexual and third-gender people (TGP) separately, and analysed with the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. Our results show that the incentives and outcomes of SMEn are not identical across different gender groups; rather, socially excluded TGP take advantage of social media differently than their heterosexual counterpart. More specifically, habit is the strongest predictor of SMEn for the heterosexual group, which is emotional reassurance for the TGP. Interestingly, identity management is an important determinant of SMEn only for TGP, while social interaction is important for both groups. We further find that SMEn enhances both groups' quality of life and social self-esteem but more for TGP. This study advances knowledge by applying UGT in a new research setting within information systems. The findings provide guidelines to social media architects and policymakers on engaging socially disadvantaged people with social media and enhancing their social wellbeing.},

Resource constrained devices face serious issues to run complex cryptographic algorithms. Trying to evaluate the performance impact of those algorithms in usual and common devices used in smart homes, in this paper we tested the impact of different cryptographic algorithms in low computational devices, typically used in smart devices applied in smart homes, testing different security configurations and using the two most used transport protocols (HTTP and MQTT). The experiment measures their effects on six commonly used embedded devices in IoT WSNs: ESP8622, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi (RPi) from 1 to 4. The experiment measured the power consumption, message delay, and additional message length (bytes). Moreover, the analysis was also used to model security algorithms. The experimental results from long runs (72 hours) reveal the cryptographic solution choice is significant for the message delay and additional message length.},

This paper aims to strengthen our understanding of the market evolution through an analysis of risks on P2P lending platforms, which can be significantly affected by the way the platform design, regulatory structural building, nature of the transaction, and interdependencies between organizational components. We extend the social-technical model and create a systematic framework to map and analyze the financial risks from a hybrid financial and organizational approach. By implementing textual and statistical analysis on a dataset from Renrendai platform, we found that risks are generated not only from the stakeholders but also due to the weaknesses of interdependencies between organizational components and platform design. We also utilize our models to investigate why some P2P platforms such as LendingClub and Upstart (US), Renrendai (China), and Zopa (UK) have succeeded or failed from both finance and IS perspectives, and further propose potential risk-mitigation strategies for P2P lending platforms.},

   abstract                      = {This study investigates the role of mobile money innovations in the incidence of income inequality on poverty and severity of poverty in 42 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 1980 to 2019. Mobile money innovations are understood as the mobile used to send money and the mobile used to pay bills online while income inequality is measured with the Gini index. Poverty is measured as the poverty headcount ratio while the severity of poverty is generated as the squared of the poverty gap index. The empirical evidence is based on interactive Quantile regressions. The following main findings are established. (i) Income inequality unconditionally reduces poverty and the severity of poverty though the significance is not throughout the conditional distributions of poverty and the severity of poverty. (ii) Mobile money innovations significantly moderate the positive incidence of income inequality on poverty and the severity of poverty in some quantiles. (iii) Positive net effects are apparent exclusively in the poverty regressions. (iv) Given the negative conditional effects, policy thresholds or minimum mobile money innovation levels needed to completely nullify the positive incidence of income inequality on poverty are provided: 27.666 (% age 15 +) and 24.000 (% age 15 +) of the mobile used to send money in the 50th and 75th quantiles, respectively and 16.272 (% age 15 +) and 13.666 (% age 15 +) of the mobile used to pay bills online in the 10th and 50th quantiles, respectively. Policy implications are discussed with respect of SDG1 on poverty reduction and SDG10 on inequality mitigation.},
