   abstract                      = {Abstract The success of digital platforms can be attributed to the engagement of autonomous complementors as exemplified by e-commerce Content Management System (CMS) platforms such as WordPress and Shopify. Platform owners provide Platform Boundary Resources (PBRs) to stimulate and control complementor engagement. Despite the increasing scholarly interest in digital platform ecosystems, their exact role in facilitating and channeling complementor engagement remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted an embedded case study on CMS platform ecosystems, comprising a total of 24 interviews with platform owners and complementors. We inductively derive five types of complementor engagement and their respective manifestations and two overarching engagement goals of complementors. Moreover, we determine the different types of PBRs utilized, including their critical effects, and distinguish between uniform and individual PBRs reflecting their respective generalizability and scalability. We discuss the findings by introducing the concepts of complementor resourcing and complementor securing and shed light on the standardization-individualization tension of PBRs faced by platform owners.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract While many data-driven businesses have seen rapid growth in recent years, their business development might be highly contingent upon data protection regulation. While it is often claimed that stricter regulation penalizes firms, there is only scarce empirical evidence for this. We therefore study how data protection regulation affects startup innovation, exploring this question during the ongoing introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our results show that the effects of data protection regulation on startup innovation are complex: it simultaneously stimulates and constrains innovation. We identify six distinct firm responses to the effects of the GDPR; three that stimulate innovation, and three that constrain it. We furthermore identify two key stipulations in the GDPR that account for the most important innovation constraints. Implications and potential policy responses are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Addiction in the context of information technology gained increased public interest within the last years. Only recently, companies like Apple, Google, and Instagram announced to fight smartphone addiction and integrated matching features in their systems. However, if and how these features really help is still an open question. At present, there is only a very rudimentary understanding of IT-triggered disorders and addictions in information systems. Even in clinical research, there is no consensus on the nature of these addictions yet. Nevertheless, the omnipresence of information technology in our daily lives and its unpredictable effects on our moods require this problem to be addressed in a profound manner. This paper links findings from psychology and neuroscience to the information systems terminology and derives the Four-Component Model for Non-addictive Information Systems (4-NAIS). The 4-NAIS allows locating how information technology interacts with the reinforcement cycle of addictions and provides a deeper understanding of where interventions and design decisions may really help tackle IT-triggered disorders.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Organizations often adopt enterprise architecture (EA) when planning how best to develop their information technology (IT) or businesses, for strategic management, or generally for managing change initiatives. This variety of different uses affects many stakeholders within and between organizations. Because stakeholders have dissimilar backgrounds, positions, assumptions, and activities, they respond differently to changes and the potential problems that emerge from those changes. This situation creates contradictions and conflicts between stakeholders that may further influence project activities and ultimately determine how EA is adopted. In this paper, we examine how institutional pressures influence EA adoption. Based on a qualitative case study of two cases, we show how regulative, normative, and cognitive pressures influence stakeholders’ activities and behaviors during the process of EA adoption. Our contribution thus lies in identifying roles of institutional pressures in different phases during the process of EA adoption and how it changes overtime. The results provide insights into EA adoption and the process of institutionalization, which help to explain emergent challenges in EA adoption.},

By using the findings from 69 studies, this research identified best (e.g. argument quality, valence, eWOM usefulness, trust in message), promising (e.g. eWOM credibility, emotional trust, attitude towards website) and least effective (e.g. volume, existing eWOM, source credibility) predictors of intention to buy in eWOM research. Additionally, the effect size of each predictor was calculated by performing meta-analysis. For academics, understanding what influences consumers’ intention to buy will help set the agenda for future research directions; for practitioners, it will provide benefit in terms of practical guidance based on detailed analysis of specific factors influencing consumers’ intention to buy, which could enhance their marketing activities.},

However, when people engage with technologies in their everyday lives, they not only enact the material attributes of the artifact but also draw on their skills, social positions, prior experience and societal norms and expectations to make use of the artifact. Drawing on Orlikowski’s analytical framework of “technologies-in-practice” we engage in an interview-based exploratory study among diverse groups of users in urban India to understand use of VUIs as situated practice. We identify three technologies-in-practice emerging through enactment of VUIs on users’ smartphones: looking up, learning and leisure. We argue that – instead of asking why and how users appropriate VUIs – identifying different kinds of enactments of VUIs present researchers and practitioners with a more nuanced understanding of existing and potential use of VUIs across varied contexts.},

Following a design science research approach including ethnographic fieldwork and prototype tests with focus groups, we find that Augmented Reality smart glass applications offer potential for service innovation in the health care sector. Our smart glass prototype supports health care professionals during wound treatment by allowing them to document procedures hands-free while they perform them. Furthermore, we investigate the use of audio based and physical interaction with the smart glasses in a within-subjects design experiment.},

One concern associated with adopting such preventive measures is the risk of privacy infringement. Therefore, it is necessary to design the future Internet infrastructure so that it can appropriately balance preventive cybersecurity measures with privacy protections. This research proposes to design the Internet infrastructure using the preventive cybersecurity measures of the Bright Internet, namely preventive cybersecurity protocol and identifiable anonymity protocol , and ten privacy rights derived from Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). We then analyze the legitimacy of the five steps of the preventive cybersecurity protocol and the four features of the identifiable anonymity protocol from the perspectives of ten privacy rights. We address the legitimacy from the perspective of potential victims’ self-defense rights. Finally, we discuss four potential risks that may occur to the innocent senders and proposed resilient recovery procedures.},

While big data and analytics have drawn extensive scholarly attention, the research focusing particularly on game analytics is scant and largely descriptive. Thus, there is a need for research focusing on how game companies employ analytics. In this study, we analyze data collected through a set of in-depth interviews of small and medium-sized freemium game developers. We identify four main roles of game analytics: 1) sense-making device, 2) decision-support system, 3) communication tool, and 4) hygiene factor. We employ the attention-based view of the firm to discuss how these roles diverge and converge in terms of organizational attention. The study advances the research on the roles and business value of analytics in the game and software industry.},

By 2021, digital assistants will outnumber humans. No one seems to stop to ask if creating more digital companions that appear increasingly human is really beneficial to the future of our species. In this essay, we pose the question: “How human should computer-based human-likeness appear?” We rely on the philosophy of humanness and the theory of speech acts to consider the long-term consequences of living with digital creatures that express human-like feelings. We argue that feelings are the very substance of our humanness and therefore are best reserved for human interaction.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Following the growing popularity of social commerce sites, there is an increased interest in understanding how consumers decide what products to purchase based on the available information. Consumers nowadays are confronted with the task of assessing marketer-generated (MGC) as well as user-generated information (UGC) in a range of different forms to make informed purchase-related decisions. This study examines the information types and forms that influence consumers in their decision-making process on social commerce. Building on uses and gratifications and dual-process theories, we distinguish between marketer and user generated content, and differentiate formats into informational and normative. Using a mixed methods approach that builds on an eye-tracking study, followed by semi-structured interviews with 23 participants, our results indicate significant differences in the types and format of information consumed for selected versus eliminated products. Specifically, we looked at engagement, cognitive processing, and observation of consumers, since they reveal information about the mental and processing mechanisms during decision making. We find that consumers present a number of differences in terms of these measures among the different types of content, and with respect to selected versus eliminated products. The outcomes of the interviews also serve to complement these findings, providing more detailed information about the processes and emotional states of consumers during the selection process.},

This study located UTAUT2 based empirical studies in the Scopus and Web of Science bibliographic database through citied reference search in order to evaluate appropriate usage of UTAUT2 constructs. The meta-analysis results spanning across 60 studies with more than 122,000 cumulative observations found BI➔UB as the strongest path with all significant values. PE➔BI emerged as the most utilized path with most significant values underscoring the emphasis placed by consumers on utilitarian value. Meanwhile, with most non-significant path values the future usage of EE➔BI path is been cautioned and questioned. Finally, trust, personal innovativeness, perceived risk, attitude, and self-efficacy were found as the five topmost UTAUT2 extensions.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Mitigating misinformation on social media is an unresolved challenge, particularly because of the complexity of information dissemination. To this end, Multivariate Hawkes Processes (MHP) have become a fundamental tool because they model social network dynamics, which facilitates execution and evaluation of mitigation policies. In this paper, we propose a novel light-weight intervention-based misinformation mitigation framework using decentralized Learning Automata (LA) to control the MHP. Each automaton is associated with a single user and learns to what degree that user should be involved in the mitigation strategy by interacting with a corresponding MHP, and performing a joint random walk over the state space. We use three Twitter datasets to evaluate our approach, one of them being a new COVID-19 dataset provided in this paper. Our approach shows fast convergence and increased valid information exposure. These results persisted independently of network structure, including networks with central nodes, where the latter could be the root of misinformation . Further, the LA obtained these results in a decentralized manner, facilitating distributed deployment in real-life scenarios.},

The conceptual model was proposed using theories including the social support theory, the trust theory, the social presence theory, the flow theory and the service-dominant logic theory. Using Facebook online community, the data were collected from 400 respondents from Jordan and analysed using AMOS based structural equation modelling. Results revealed that social commerce constructs positively influence social support, community members’ trust and social presence. Furthermore, it was found that social support and social presence positively affect community members’ trust. We also found that community members’ trust positively influence flow whereas both community members’ trust and flow positively influence community engagement.},

This article aims at providing a systematic overview of the current state of the emerging research field of Universal Design of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Emergency Management, and to highlight high-impact research opportunities to ensure that the increasing introduction of ICT in Emergency Management can contribute to removing barriers instead of adding more barriers, in particular for the elderly and people with disabilities. A systematic review on relevant literature on Universal Design, ICT and Emergency Management between 2008 and 2020 was employed using predefined frameworks, to answer the following questions: (1) Who are the target audiences (stakeholders) in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency Management in the different categories of Emergency Management ICT tools, and to what degree is Human-Centred Design and Universal Design taken into account? (2) What are the most important challenges and gaps in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency Management? We identify a set of gaps in the literature, indicating that there are some challenges where Universal Design is still limitedly addressed in technology development. We also derive promising future research topics based on areas that are missing in the literature.},

Production is further allocated into cyberattack or stockpiling. Applying the Cobb Douglas expected utility function for equivalent players, an analytical solution is determined where each player’s expected utility is inverse U shaped in each player’s unit defense cost. More generally, simulations illustrate the impact of varying nine parameter values relative to a benchmark. Increasing a player’s unit costs of defense or development of zero-days benefits the opposing player. Increasing the contest intensities over the two players’ assets causes the players to increase their efforts until their resources are fully exploited and they receive zero expected utility. Decreasing the Cobb Douglas output elasticity for a player’s stockpiling of zero-days causes its attack to increase and its expected utility to eventually reach a maximum, while the opposing player’s expected utility reaches a minimum. Altering the Cobb Douglas output elasticities for a player’s attack or defense contests towards their maxima or minima causes maximum expected utility for both players.},

The paper adopts a quasi-experimental design based on the analysis of multiple cases with each case replicating prior findings either literally or theoretically. The study uses a mix of survey, interview, and electronic data informed by an innovative, set-theoretic approach to distill commonalities within positive cases and differences between positive and negative cases. It shows that attracting new customers and raising the company’s profile are necessary pre-requisites for adaptive acceptance of social media policy changes. In addition, these two conditions combined with learning to use social media effortlessly are jointly sufficient for adaptive acceptance. Theoretical, practical, and methodological implications are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Extant academic research provides a comprehensive view of online consumer behaviour on a single website, paying less attention to the integrated environment in which websites operate. Retailers’ products, however, are not only available on their own website, but also through other connected channels such as comparison sites. Our limited knowledge of consumers’ integrated behaviour across the entire market poses difficulties to design effective online strategies. At the same time, practitioners have mainly focused on website performance measures, ignoring the reasons behind the behaviour of consumers. A deeper understanding of consumers who visit different websites or, cross-visit, can inform successful online channel strategies. This macro-level study aims to bridge this gap by investigating how the usage behaviour on retailers’ websites and comparison sites influences each other, using large-scale industry-based data. A new measure of ‘cross-visiting’ behaviour is introduced and examined.},

Emergency Management Agencies can distribute helpful and important information to the general public and also gather information to enrich their management efforts. This, however, remains challenging since several communication-related barriers occur. This study investigates how the concept of Nudging, a form of behaviour adjustment, can be applied to address these barriers. A Systematic Literature Review and qualitative social media data analysis methods were applied to explore the potential of digital nudges on social media. Twelve forms of digital nudges could be identified in the data that influenced the visibility of the messages they occurred in. The results suggest that Digital Nudging on Social Media is a promising approach to use in emergency and disaster communication.},

Although the widespread use of futuristic robotaxis and self-driving commercial vehicles has not yet become a reality, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different fields. We have witnessed the equivalent of two years of digital transformation compressed into just a few months. Whether it is in tracing epidemiological peaks or in transacting contactless payments, the impact of these developments has been almost immediate, and a window has opened up on what is to come. Here we analyze and discuss how AI can support us in facing the ongoing pandemic. Despite the numerous and undeniable contributions of AI, clinical trials and human skills are still required. Even if different strategies have been developed in different states worldwide, the fight against the pandemic seems to have found everywhere a valuable ally in AI, a global and open-source tool capable of providing assistance in this health emergency. A careful AI application would enable us to operate within this complex scenario involving healthcare, society and research.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This paper examines the affordances of Reddit , a digital media platform where Users share and discuss content. The aim of the study was to understand the affordances of Reddit, and how the affordances of Reddit through various features of the platform lead to outcomes, specifically those relating to political loyalty and the creation of political narratives. The study contributes an insight into the evolution and understanding of affordances as a result of examining the ways in which individuals who were previously members of another political group constructed narratives around switching their support to the Trump campaign in the 2016 US presidential elections. The study specifically focusses on an exclusive membership community called r/ The_Donald . As a result of analysing posts on common themes using Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA), we conclude that the features enable membership of a community to be rewarded, switched or denied. As a result, this study has identified five affordances of Reddit, which include credibility, expressing oneself freely, echoing beliefs, creating membership and the meta-affordance ‘Redpilling’. The outcomes of these affordances are that ingroups are created, support can be switched, extreme or hateful views are legitimised and a new brand of conservatism is given credibility. This in turn is concluded to have realised impacts outside of the virtual environment in this case on the self-reported behaviours of voters.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract This study investigates how tablet users react when technology falls short of their expectations. We deploy a data/frame model to study this process and investigate resistance-related reactions and the deployment of accommodating practices at the individual level. Analyzing user blogs that provide narratives on user interaction with tablets, we identify triggers of episodes of disillusionment and illustrate five sensemaking paths that users follow, eventually leading to one of three practices: 1) users choose to defer tasks until the situation changes, or they abandon the platform altogether; 2) they develop workarounds at different levels of proficiency; or 3) they proceed by reframing their expectations of the platform. By revealing user decision-making process during episodes of disillusionment, the findings contribute to information systems post-adoption research. At a practical level, the findings inform IT artifact and application design by offering insights on how users process discrepancies between their expectations and actual use experience.},

In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based scheme that allows users to have control over the personal data revealed when accessing a service. The proposed solution does not rely on sophisticated cryptographic primitives, provides mechanisms for revoking the authorization to access a service and for guessing the identity of a user only in cases of need, and is compliant with the recent eIDAS Regulation. We prove that the proposed scheme is secure and reaches the expected goal, and we present an Ethereum-based implementation to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract E-learning systems are receiving ever increasing attention in academia, business and public administration. Major crises, like the pandemic, highlight the tremendous importance of the appropriate development of e-learning systems and its adoption and processes in organizations. Managers and employees who need efficient forms of training and learning flow within organizations do not have to gather in one place at the same time or to travel far away to attend courses. Contemporary affordances of e-learning systems allow users to perform different jobs or tasks for training courses according to their own scheduling, as well as to collaborate and share knowledge and experiences that result in rich learning flows within organizations. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic review of empirical studies at the intersection of e-learning and organizational learning in order to summarize the current findings and guide future research. Forty-seven peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. This survey identifies five major directions of the research on the confluence of e-learning and organizational learning during the last decade. Future research should leverage big data produced from the platforms and investigate how the incorporation of advanced learning technologies (e.g., learning analytics, personalized learning) can help increase organizational value.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The rapid development of e-commerce has led to a swiftly increasing number of competing providers in electronic markets, which maintain their own, individual data describing the offered items. Recommender systems are popular and powerful tools relying on this data to guide users to their individually best item choice. Literature suggests that data quality of item content data has substantial influence on recommendation quality. Thereby, the dimension completeness is expected to be particularly important. Herein resides a considerable chance to improve recommendation quality by increasing completeness via extending an item content data set with an additional data set of the same domain. This paper therefore proposes a procedure for such a systematic data extension and analyzes effects of the procedure regarding items, content and users based on real-world data sets from four leading web portals. The evaluation results suggest that the proposed procedure is indeed effective in enabling improved recommendation quality.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Owing to technological advancements in artificial intelligence, voice assistants (VAs) offer speech as a new interaction modality. Compared to text-based interaction, speech is natural and intuitive, which is why companies use VAs in customer service. However, we do not yet know for which kinds of tasks speech is beneficial. Drawing on task-technology fit theory, we present a research model to examine the applicability of VAs to different tasks. To test this model, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 116 participants who had to complete an information search task with a VA or a chatbot. The results show that speech exhibits higher perceived efficiency, lower cognitive effort, higher enjoyment, and higher service satisfaction than text-based interaction. We also find that these effects depend on the task’s goal-directedness. These findings extend task-technology fit theory to customers’ choice of interaction modalities and inform practitioners about the use of VAs for information search tasks.},

OBMs exist notwithstanding adverse conditions such as police interventions, scams and market breakdowns. Relying on a longitudinal case study, we focus on the dynamics of interactions among actors and marketplace technologies and we identify three mechanisms explaining OBMs operations. In particular, we show that OBMs infrastructure is the result of commoditization, platformization and resilience processes. Our contribution relies on the identification of community-based mechanisms that generate the OBMs infrastructure, extending the current understanding of e-commerce and social commerce.},

To address these challenges, many SMEs leveraged information and communication technologies (ICTs), with some even emerging strengthened from the crisis. Drawing on the technology-organization-environment framework and technology-affordances-and-constraints theory, we investigate the adoption of ICTs as a crisis response strategy in 10 SMEs in the German business event (e.g., corporate events, conferences) industry. Our findings reveal that ICT adoption not only depends on rational decisions based on organizational, environmental, and technological characteristics, but also on these dimensions’ interrelationship and the specific ICTs’ affordances and constraints. Introducing readily available ICTs (e.g., video-conferencing) has significant potential in addressing physical distancing in the short and medium term, while more sophisticated ICTs (e.g., virtual reality) are more likely to gain importance in the long term. Thus, we expand our understanding of organizational technology adoption and ICT-enabled crisis response strategies in SMEs.},

Intelligence amplification does not replace human decision makers but may help especially professionals in making complex decisions by well-designed human-AI system learning interactions (i.e., triple loop learning). To understand the adoption challenges of intelligence amplification systems, we analyse the adoption of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) as an organizational learning process by the case of a CDSS implementation for deciding on administering antibiotics to prematurely born babies. We identify user-oriented single and double loop learning processes, triple loop learning, and institutional deutero learning processes as organizational learning processes that must be realized for effective intelligence amplification adoption. We summarize these insights in a system dynamic model—containing knowledge stocks and their transformation processes—by which we analytically structure insights from the diverse studies of CDSS and intelligence amplification adoption and by which intelligence amplification projects are given an analytic theory for their design and management. From our case study, we find multiple challenges of deutero learning that influence the effectiveness of IA implementation learning as transforming tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and explicit knowledge back to tacit knowledge. In a discussion of implications, we generate further research directions and discuss the generalization of our case findings to different organizations.},

One emerging technology with the potential to help address the resulting shortage in health care providers and other barriers to treatment access are conversational agents (CAs). CAs are software-based systems designed to interact with humans through natural language. However, CAs do not live up to their full potential yet because they are unable to capture dynamic human behavior to an adequate extent to provide responses tailored to users’ personalities. To address this problem, we conducted a design science research (DSR) project to design personality-adaptive conversational agents (PACAs). Following an iterative and multi-step approach, we derive and formulate six design principles for PACAs for the domain of mental health care. The results of our evaluation with psychologists and psychiatrists suggest that PACAs can be a promising source of mental health support. With our design principles, we contribute to the body of design knowledge for CAs and provide guidance for practitioners who intend to design PACAs. Instantiating the principles may improve interaction with users who seek support for mental health issues.},

The research focuses on SMEs with worldwide employees and involves data collected from a range of different employees belonging to four different managerial levels. The process incorporated the analysis of 669 questionnaires to test the proposed hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings suggest that, together, TOE factors represent crucial inputs for green practices such as green training, green performance appraisal, that, in turn, mean critical processes lead to sustainable performance (output). Additionally, the findings should also inspire SMEs to focus even more effort on internal technological and organisational factors and to encourage an eco-friendly culture that would demand stakeholders adopt a more positive environmental stance.},

In this experimental survey study with open-ended qualitative questions, we examine decision making in six HRM functions and manipulate the decision maker (AI or human) and decision valence (positive or negative) to determine their impact on individuals’ experiences of interactional justice, trust, dehumanization, and perceptions of decision-maker role appropriateness. In terms of decision makers, the use of human decision makers over AIs generally resulted in better perceptions of respectful treatment. In terms of decision valence, people experiencing positive over negative decisions generally resulted in better perceptions of respectful treatment. In instances where these cases conflict, on some indicators people preferred positive AI decisions over negative human decisions. Qualitative responses show how people identify justice concerns with both AI and human decision making. We outline implications for theory, practice, and future research.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Propelled by digitalisation, crowd knowledge (CK) has gained popularity alongside a plurality of related crowd-based concepts (crowdsourcing, wisdom of crowds and collective intelligence), resulting in an inconsistent understanding of the terms and their application. Based on a structured literature review, we conceptualise CK and develop a formal definition, which is then evaluated using knowledge artefacts on different crowd-related platforms and differentiation criteria in relation to participants, context, purpose and process. The paper posits that CK is conceptually different from related concepts, due to its dynamic nature and its instantiation in the form of a CK knowledge artefact which requires a specific context and a unique knowledge-creation process. Furthermore, we discuss how the concept of CK and its associated artefact relates to established knowledge management concepts such as knowledge assets and the flow of CK in the epistemological differentiation of knowledge into tacit and explicit elements. The article contributes to the formal conceptualisation of crowd-based concepts and therefore improves understanding of existing implementations and supports the prudent design of future systems.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Co-production and active participation of the consumers are considered to have enhanced the value co-creation activities that would ensure business benefits of a firm. The marketing literature available does not explicitly explain the philosophy that would motivate the consumers to help to increase values for co-creation activities. In this context, attempts have been made to identify the factors that would impact on co-production and consumers’ participation to co-create values. By studying literature and theories such as theory of co-creation, theory of value creation, information processing theory, marketing theory and expectancy value theory, a conceptual model called F-P-C-B (Future Participation (F) - Co-production (P) - Co-creation (C) - Business Benefit (B)) has been developed along with nine hypotheses. The data was from 362 respondents in India and the model was tested using PLS based analysis. The study shows that it is important for the firms to shift from product-oriented activities to customer-related strategies. It is also found that for obtaining more profitability and better business results, customers should be involved in business activities by way of involving in co-design, idea generation, and other relevant activities of the firms. Moreover, the study highlights that knowledge sharing between the customers and the firm authorities ensures better business values.},

Using an in-depth single case study, the digital divide is explored and understood using technology-mediated learning for older adults when using smart devices; ie. tablet devices. The case study is based on a group of educated, older Indian adult volunteers at a local Punjabi radio station. A qualitative approach used the data collection techniques of interviews, observations, informal conversations and reference to archival documents and interpretivism for analysis. Our findings revealed that older adults with ailments have shorter lives, contrary to popular perception, can be very active in their communities, are able to use basic IT and are willing to use technology when it leads to significant tangible or intangible benefits without considering the remaining time of their lives. Contributions for policymakers and industry are also offered in this paper.},

Thus, the knowledgebase related to interaction with IAs has grown exponentially but remains segregated and impedes the advancement of the field. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature review to integrate empirical knowledge on user interaction with IAs. This is the first paper to examine 107 Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction papers and identified 389 relationships between design elements and user acceptance of IAs. Along the independent and dependent variables of these relationships, we span a research space model encompassing empirical research on designing for IA user acceptance. Further we contribute to theory, by presenting a research agenda along the dimensions of the research space, which shall be useful to both researchers and practitioners. This complements the past and present knowledge on designing for IA user acceptance with potential pathways into the future of IAs.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) are a wide-ranging set of technologies that promise several advantages for organizations in terms off added business value. Over the past few years, organizations are increasingly turning to AI in order to gain business value following a deluge of data and a strong increase in computational capacity. Nevertheless, organizations are still struggling to adopt and leverage AI in their operations. The lack of a coherent understanding of how AI technologies create business value, and what type of business value is expected, therefore necessitates a holistic understanding. This study provides a systematic literature review that attempts to explain how organizations can leverage AI technologies in their operations and elucidate the value-generating mechanisms. Our analysis synthesizes the current literature and highlights: (1) the key enablers and inhibitors of AI adoption and use; (2) the typologies of AI use in the organizational setting; and (3) the first- and second-order effects of AI. The paper concludes with an identification of the gaps in the literature and develops a research agenda that identifies areas that need to be addressed by future studies.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract One realm of AI, recommender systems have attracted significant research attention due to concerns about its devastating effects to society’s most vulnerable and marginalised communities. Both media press and academic literature provide compelling evidence that AI-based recommendations help to perpetuate and exacerbate racial and gender biases. Yet, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which individuals might question AI-based recommendations when perceived as biased. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigate the effects of espoused national cultural values on AI questionability, by examining how individuals might question AI-based recommendations due to perceived racial or gender bias. Data collected from 387 survey respondents in the United States indicate that individuals with espoused national cultural values associated to collectivism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance are more likely to question biased AI-based recommendations. This study advances understanding of how cultural values affect AI questionability due to perceived bias and it contributes to current academic discourse about the need to hold AI accountable.},

An increasing number of studies focus on the security, privacy and risks within smart cities, highlighting the threats relating to information security and challenges for smart city infrastructure in the management and processing of personal data. This study analyses many of these challenges, offers a valuable synthesis of the relevant key literature, and develops a smart city interaction framework. The study is organised around a number of key themes within smart cities research: privacy and security of mobile devices and services; smart city infrastructure, power systems, healthcare, frameworks, algorithms and protocols to improve security and privacy, operational threats for smart cities, use and adoption of smart services by citizens, use of blockchain and use of social media. This comprehensive review provides a useful perspective on many of the key issues and offers key direction for future studies. The findings of this study can provide an informative research framework and reference point for academics and practitioners.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) organize themselves into clusters by sharing a set of limited resources to achieve the holistic success of the cluster. However, these SMEs often face conflicts and deadlock situations that hinder the fundamental operational dynamics of the cluster due to varied reasons, including lack of trust and transparency in interactions, lack of common consensus, and lack of accountability and non-repudiation. Blockchain technology brings trust, transparency, and traceability to systems, as demonstrated by previous research and practice. In this paper, we explore the role of blockchain technology in building a trustworthy yet collaborative environment in SME clusters through the principles of community self-governance based on the work of Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom. We develop and present a blockchain commons governance framework for the three main dimensions i.e., interaction, autonomy, and control, based on the theoretical premise of equivalence mapping and qualitative analysis. This paper examines the role of blockchain technology to act as a guiding mechanism and support the smooth functioning of SMEs for their holistic good. The study focuses on sustainability and improving productivity of SMEs operating in clusters under public and private partnership. This is the first study to address the operational challenges faced by SEMs in clusters by highlighting the dimensions of blockchain commons governance dimensions.},

The theoretical framing considers both drivers and barriers when combines the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) with innovation resistance theory (IRT). To empirically verify the proposed model, this study gathers primary data through a web-based, self-administered survey. To analyze the data, we use structural equation modeling, and to test for significant differences between the two groups we run multi-group analysis. The respondents in Italy and China present different behaviors. Social influence plays a significant role in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, such as Italy. The tradition barrier is the only significant barrier to the adoption of mobile payment.},

This paper examined factors that can be employed to build consumer trust and continuance intention to use e-tail platforms in Sub-Saharan Africa. Survey data was collected from 207 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling with the PLS software. The results show that information quality, perceived usefulness, hedonic motivation, and perceived risk have a significant influence on consumers’ trust in e-tail platforms. The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge that guides efforts for the implementation of actions in weak institutional contexts characterized by institutional voids such as those experienced in Sub-Saharan African countries. Finally, the study provides insights that can help managers of e-tail platforms to effectively foster the development of trust in their communities.},

To add crisis time evidence to the body of work, and based on World Bank Enterprise Survey data, this inquiry interrogates 249 small manufacturing firms in Italy by examining the effect of e-commerce on (1) resilience, (2) direct exports and (3) indirect exports. The results show that while e-commerce has a positive impact on direct exports, a negative influence is recorded on indirect exports. Besides, e-commerce significantly increases resilience which, in turn, accelerates direct exports. However, resilience is found to have a trivial influence on indirect exporting. Furthermore, held as a constant, firm size demonstrates a significant and positive effect on direct and indirect exports. These fresh findings prompt implications for understanding the correlates of e-commerce, resilience and export behaviour. Practically, there are salient insights for stakeholders engaged in reviving small manufacturers’ exports for a speedy post COVID-19 recovery in Italy.},

Lower demand and ample supply means that users have a great deal of choice. Finding ways for properties to differentiate themselves has been a pressing need. Against this background, this paper pursued two objectives: firstly to explore the perceived functional and emotional value of smart accommodation and the factors contributing to this by adopting the Theory of Consumption Values, and secondly to examine the role of perceived value in driving intention to stay in smart accommodation in the future. 430 responses were collected to analyse the relationships among antecedents, value and intention. The results showed that the functional value of smart accommodation is associated with the perception that such accommodation represents good value for the price, smart devices are useful, they can enhance control of stay experiences, and there are resources and opportunities facilitating the use of technology. Emotional value is determined by the perception that staying in smart accommodation represents sustainable behaviour, the integration of smart home technologies offers control over the stay experience, improves the entertainment experience, aesthetics and playfulness of using technology. Emotional values are inhibited by the perception of surveillance in smart accommodation. Also, the study offers evidence of the correlation of intention with functional and emotional value. The evidence contributes to the literature by explaining the potential implications of innovative technologies for business recovery in the post-pandemic reality, exploring the applications of smart technologies in delivering tourism services, and identifying the factors in the adoption of smart homes in the hospitality sector. The findings provide practical implications for facilitating the applications of innovative technology and its adoption in home and non-home environments.},

The design principles contribute to the current research stream on automated facilitation and can guide providers of idea platforms to enhance idea generation and subsequent idea selection processes.

Fisheries in developing nations are one such sector where the complexity is not only due to the produce being perishable but also due to the livelihood dependence of others in the coastal regions that belong to the section of economically disadvantaged. This paper explains the contextual challenges of fish supply chain in a developing country and describes how integrating disruptive technologies can address those challenges. Through a positive deviance approach, we show how firms can help unorganized supply chains with economically disadvantaged suppliers by carefully redesigning the supply chain through the integration of satellite imagery and blockchain technology. With COVID-19 in the backdrop, we highlight how such technologies significantly improves the supply chain resilience and at the same time contributes to the income generating opportunities of poor fisherfolks in developing nations. Our study has important implications to both developing markets and food supply chain practitioners as this paper tackles issues such as perishability, demand-supply mismatch, unfair prices, and quality related data transparency in the entire value chain.},

Rumors can mislead public opinion, weaken social order, decrease the legitimacy of government, and lead to a significant threat to social stability. Therefore, timely detection and debunking rumor are urgently needed. In this work, we proposed an Attention-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that uses tweet text with thirteen different linguistic and user features to distinguish rumor and non-rumor tweets. The performance of the proposed Attention-based LSTM model is compared with several conventional machine and deep learning models. The proposed Attention-based LSTM model achieved an F 1 -score of 0.88 in classifying rumor and non-rumor tweets, which is better than the state-of-the-art results. The proposed system can reduce the impact of rumors on society and weaken the loss of life, money, and build the firm trust of users with social media platforms.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Computing path queries such as the shortest path in public transport networks is challenging because the path costs between nodes change over time. A reachability query from a node at a given start time on such a network retrieves all points of interest (POIs) that are reachable within a given cost budget. Reachability queries are essential building blocks in many applications, for example, group recommendations, ranking spatial queries, or geomarketing. We propose an efficient solution for reachability queries in public transport networks. Currently, there are two options to solve reachability queries. (1) Execute a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm that supports time-dependent edge traversal costs; this solution is slow since it must expand edge by edge and does not use an index. (2) Issue a separate path query for each single POI, i.e., a single reachability query requires answering many path queries. None of these solutions scales to large networks with many POIs. We propose a novel and lightweight reachability index. The key idea is to partition the network into cells. Then, in contrast to other approaches, we expand the network cell by cell. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world networks confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of our index-based reachability query solution.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing quickly, and systems can increasingly perform a multitude of tasks that previously required human intelligence. Information systems can facilitate collaboration between humans and AI systems such that their individual capabilities complement each other. However, there is a lack of consolidated design guidelines for information systems facilitating the collaboration between humans and AI systems. This work examines how agent transparency affects trust and task outcomes in the context of human-AI collaboration. Drawing on the 3-Gap framework, we study agent transparency as a means to reduce the information asymmetry between humans and the AI. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we formulate testable propositions, derive design requirements, and synthesize design principles. We instantiate two design principles as design features of an information system utilized in the hospitality industry. Further, we conduct two case studies to evaluate the effects of agent transparency: We find that trust increases when the AI system provides information on its reasoning, while trust decreases when the AI system provides information on sources of uncertainty. Additionally, we observe that agent transparency improves task outcomes as it enhances the accuracy of judgemental forecast adjustments.},

The systematic and data-driven analysis of social media to generate business value is summarized under the term Social Media Analytics which includes statistical, network-based and language-based approaches. We focus on textual data and investigate which conversation topics arise during the time of a new product introduction on Twitter and how the overall sentiment is during and after the event. The analysis via Natural Language Processing tools is conducted in two languages and four different countries, such that cultural differences in the tonality and customer needs can be identified for the product. Different methods of sentiment analysis and topic modeling are compared to identify the usability in social media and in the respective languages English and German. Furthermore, we illustrate the importance of preprocessing steps when applying these methods and identify relevant product insights.},

Whilst existing IS work has explored various factors influencing STS development, there is a lack of consideration of how value can be created for building a more sustainable STS. Drawing upon the value co-creation theory and stakeholder theory, we seek to understand the socio-technical shaping of the STS ecosystem and how government, firms and citizens collaboratively create sustainable value for designing and implementing STS initiatives. To reach this aim, we carry out a longitudinal case study over 2016–2018 in Shijiazhuang, China. We offer both theoretical and practical explanations on (i) key value facets with regard to sustainable STS design and implementation; and (ii) a holistic view of iterative value co-creation process pushed by key stakeholders. This study makes particular contributions to the IS, marketing and transportation literature by offering a critical understanding of the social dynamics for shaping a big data-driven STS ecosystem.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The emerging information revolution makes it necessary to manage vast amounts of unstructured data rapidly. As the world is increasingly populated by IoT devices and sensors that can sense their surroundings and communicate with each other, a digital environment has been created with vast volumes of volatile and diverse data. Traditional AI and machine learning techniques designed for deterministic situations are not suitable for such environments. With a large number of parameters required by each device in this digital environment, it is desirable that the AI is able to be adaptive and self-build (i.e. self-structure, self-configure, self-learn), rather than be structurally and parameter-wise pre-defined. This study explores the benefits of self-building AI and machine learning with unsupervised learning for empowering big data analytics for smart city environments. By using the growing self-organizing map, a new suite of self-building AI is proposed. The self-building AI overcomes the limitations of traditional AI and enables data processing in dynamic smart city environments. With cloud computing platforms, the self-building AI can integrate the data analytics applications that currently work in silos. The new paradigm of the self-building AI and its value are demonstrated using the IoT, video surveillance, and action recognition applications.},

This centralised model relies on using IoT data by highly qualified experts replacing previous smaller local structures. We draw on the notion of Situational Awareness to carry out the study. Results show that although the operators were not always familiar with the characteristics of locations, the use of IoT data heightened their situational awareness in the centralised control room by improving perception and comprehension. However, they still relied on local knowledge and learned experiences to support projection and anticipation of risks. The study highlights that although data analytics systems are capable of expanding operators’ perception of local elements, they must be complemented by local richer forms of information, needed to anticipate risks and make critical decisions with major impact on local population.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Agile development methodologies (ADM) have become a widely implemented project management approach in Information Systems (IS). Yet, along with its growing popularity, the amount of concerns raised in regard to human related challenges caused by applying ADM are rapidly increasing. Nevertheless, the extant scholarly literature has neglected to identify the primary origins and reasons of these challenges. The purpose of this study is therefore to examine if these human related challenges are related to a lack of Emotional Intelligence (EI) by means of a quantitative approach. From a sample of 194 agile practitioners, EI was found to be significantly correlated to human related challenges in agile teams in terms of anxiety, motivation, mutual trust and communication competence. Hence, these findings offer important new knowledge for IS-scholars, project managers and human resource practitioners, about the vital role of EI for staffing and training of agile managed IS-projects.},

In this paper, we focus on how an organization’s absorptive capacity and its enterprise system practices develop and co-evolve over time. Analysing a fifteen years’ ERP practice in an organisational context, this study synthesizes a new AC analysis framework that takes into account the dynamic nature of AC. This high-level analysis coupled with a longitudinal view resolves inconsistent results between current AC studies and suggest further directions for organisational AC research.},

Following the initial adoption phase, vendors are now concerned with the continued usage of their software. To analyze the influence of different measures to improve continued usage over time, a longitudinal study approach using data from a SaaS vendor was implemented. Employing a linear mixed model, the study finds several measures to have a positive effect on a software’s usage penetration. In addition to these activation measures performed by the SaaS vendor, software as well as client characteristics were also examined, but did not display significant estimates. The findings emphasize the need for proactive activation initiatives to raise usage penetration. More generally, the study contributes novel insights into the scarcely researched field of influencing factors on SaaS usage continuance.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract The Intentional Analytics Model (IAM) has been recently envisioned as a new paradigm to couple OLAP and analytics. It relies on two basic ideas: (i) letting the user explore data by expressing her analysis intentions rather than the data she needs, and (ii) returning enhanced cubes, i.e., multidimensional data annotated with knowledge insights in the form of interesting model components (e.g., clusters). In this paper we contribute to give a proof-of-concept for the IAM vision by delivering an end-to-end implementation of , one of the five intention operators introduced by IAM. Among the research challenges left open in IAM, those we address are (i) automatically tuning the size of models (e.g., the number of clusters), (ii) devising a measure to estimate the interestingness of model components, (iii) selecting the most effective chart or graph for visualizing each enhanced cube depending on its features, and (iv) devising a visual metaphor to display enhanced cubes and interact with them. We assess the validity of our approach in terms of user effort for formulating intentions, effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract Work and Employment is a critical area that is undergoing major change influenced by the widespread connectivity and utilisation of the Internet and the rise of digital platforms. Crowdwork is an emerging new way of working that is witnessing exponential growth. It is surrounded by a fixed debate between opposite perspectives on its impact on workers. However, both perspectives adopt a static view that does not pay much attention to crowdworkers’ progress in their job over time. In this study, we seek to advance this debate by adopting a dynamic view of crowdwork to explore the trajectory of workers over time based on their own accounts. Through rich qualitative data and inductive analysis, the study unravels that crowdworkers craft what could be conceptualised as a career development path. It identifies five stages in this career path and workers’ efforts to mould their work demands and job-related resources to create a future for themselves. The discussion shows the fruitful insight that this approach brings to theory and practice. Limitations and future avenues for research are then discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread at an unprecedented rate, many universities around the world halted physical forms of teaching and learning to stop the spread of the virus. As a result, many university students were forced to utilize online learning through channels such as mobile social media. Due to the novelty of this situation, there are many unknowns particularly with the negative influences of mobile learning via social media on university students. Thus, this study looks to examine this subject matter from the perspective of the stimulus–organism–response theory. The uniquely developed research model included four stimuli (i.e., social overload, information overload, life invasion, and privacy invasion), two organisms (i.e., technostress and exhaustion) as well as a response in terms of reduced intention to use mobile learning via social media. The responses were collected from 384 university students via an online survey and analyzed with the Partial-Least-Square-Structural-Equation-Modelling. It was found that the antecedents for both technostress and exhaustion were able to account for more than half of their respective variances. Furthermore, technostress and exhaustion were significant facilitators of the students’ reduced intention to use mobile learning via social media. In addition to the practical insights for stakeholders in the education industry, this study also posited several theoretical implications for researchers.},

However, the effect of VAs on virtual teams and collaboration remains uncertain, particularly whether employees show social loafing (SL) tendencies, i.e., applying less effort for collective tasks compared to working alone. While extant research indicates that VAs collaboratively working in teams exert greater results, less is known about SL in virtual collaboration and how responsibility attribution alters. An online experiment with N = 102 was conducted in which participants were assisted by a VA in solving a task. The results indicate SL tendencies in virtual collaboration with VAs and that participants tend to cede responsibility to the VA. This study makes a first foray and extends the information systems (IS) literature by analyzing SL and responsibility attribution thus updates our knowledge on virtual collaboration with VAs.},

However, the recent upsurge of mobile technology adoption in developing countries has provided suitable breeding ground for sharing economy. The lack of native theories in tourism and hospitality sector with scare utilization of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) provide necessity for this research. This study adapted meta-UTAUT model as theoretical lens and extended the model with hedonic motivation, trust, and self-efficacy. Based on data from 301 potential Indian consumers, the results underscored the central role of attitude that significantly mediated the effects of effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions on consumer intention to use Airbnb. Meanwhile, performance expectancy emerged as significant direct determinant of intention alongside attitude, trust, and self-efficacy. The proposed model explained as much as 65% variance on Indian consumer’s intention to use Airbnb.},

These commonly employed organizational structures are characterized by information asymmetry and decision rights afforded to the IT department. The complexity of IT and its ongoing rapid evolution lead to information asymmetry where the IT department has private information about technology and cost, and the consuming departments have private information about demand. Under the cost center organizational structure, the firm sets the quality and number of IT services offered by the IT department. Whereas under a profit center structure, the IT department makes decisions on quality, price and variety of IT services. We find that the quality of IT services under the cost center decreases with greater uncertainty in demand for IT services. We also find that the cost center structure can offer higher quality IT services than the profit center structure, and consumption of IT services can be higher under the profit center structure. The preferred organizational structure does not always provide greater variety of IT services than the alternate structure. The cost center is preferred when the marginal cost of IT services is sufficiently low, or the fixed cost of quality is sufficiently high.},

While there are claims that technologies such as analytics can help such rapid transitions, little empirical research exists that shows if or how Business Analytics (BA) supports the adaptation or innovation of SMEs’ business models, let alone within the context of extreme time pressure and turbulence. This study addresses this gap through an exemplar case, where the SME actively used location-based business analytics for rapid business model adaptation and innovation during the Covid-19 crisis. The paper contributes to existing theory by providing a set of propositions, an agenda for future research and a guide for SMEs to assess and implement their own use of analytics for business model transformation.},

Augmented reality could be used to visualize the wealth of user-generated content available on social media and enable context-adaptive functions for emergency operators. Although emergency operators agree that social media analytics will be important for their future work, it poses a challenge to filter and visualize large amounts of social media data. We conducted a goal-directed task analysis to identify the situation awareness requirements of emergency operators. By collecting tweets during two storms in Germany we evaluated the usefulness of Twitter data for achieving situation awareness and conducted interviews with emergency operators to derive filter strategies for social media data. We synthesized the results by discussing how the unique interface of augmented reality can be used to integrate social media data into emergency control rooms for situation awareness support.},

However, in Japan at large, issuing of damage certificates has taken a long time in past earthquake disasters. Hence, the government needs a more efficient mechanism for issuing damage certificates. This study developed an estimation system of roof-damaged buildings to obtain an overview of earthquake damage based on aero-photo images using deep learning. To provide speedy estimation, this system utilized the trimming algorithm, which automatically generates roof image data using the location information of building polygons on GIS (Geographic Information System). Consequently, the proposed system can estimate, if a house is covered with a blue sheet with 97.57 % accuracy and also detect whether a house is damaged, with 93.51 % accuracy. It would therefore be worth considering the development of an image recognition model and a method of collecting aero-photo data to operate this system during a real earthquake.},

In this study, we first apply a forensic process to investigate the information quality of digital evidence underlying published results. Furthermore, we use semiotics to describe the quality of information recovered from storage systems with laboratory forensics techniques. Next, we formulate laboratory analytics capabilities based on the results of the forensics analysis. Laboratory forensics and analytics form the basis of research data management. Finally, we propose a conceptual overview of open science readiness, which combines laboratory forensics techniques and laboratory analytics capabilities to help overcome research data management challenges in the near future.},

Technological frames provide a theoretical perspective for understanding how actors interpret a technology and act upon its development, use, and governance. However, we know little about how actors shape technological frames. In this paper, we study the shaping of the technological frame of the European ecosystem for responsible AI (RAI). Through an analysis of EU documents, we identified four expectations that constitute the EU’s technological frame for the RAI ecosystem. Moreover, through interviews with RAI actors, we revealed five types of expectation work responding to this frame: reproducing, translating, and extending (congruent expectation work), and scrutinizing and rooting (incongruent expectation work). Furthermore, we conceptualize expectation work as actors’ purposive actions in creating and negotiating expectations. Our study contributes to the literature on technological frames, technology-centered ecosystems, and RAI while also elucidating the dimensions and co-shaping of technological frames.},

This study, explores how AI governance is applied to promote the development of robust AI applications that do not introduce negative effects, based on a comparative case analysis of three firms in the energy sector. The study illustrates which practices are placed to produce knowledge that assists with decision making while at the same time overcoming barriers with recommended actions leading to desired outcomes.
